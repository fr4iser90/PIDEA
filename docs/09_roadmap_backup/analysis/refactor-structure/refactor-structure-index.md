#### 🔄 [Refactor Structure Implementation (German)](./refactor-structure-implementation.md)
**Purpose**: Original German analysis comparing current vs. desired layer distribution.

**Key Content**:
- **Current Structure Analysis**: Monolithic file organization issues
- **Desired Structure**: Categorized approach with proper separation
- **Migration Plan**: 4-phase implementation strategy
- **Layer-by-Layer Breakdown**: Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Presentation

### Analysis Summary

#### Current Issues Identified
1. **Monolithic Structure**: Single files containing all functionality per layer
2. **Poor Categorization**: Mixed concerns within single files
3. **Maintainability Problems**: Large, complex files difficult to maintain
4. **Testing Challenges**: Complex dependencies make testing difficult
5. **Scalability Issues**: Hard to extend with new analysis types

#### Proposed Solution
1. **Categorized Structure**: Separate files by analysis category (Security, Performance, Architecture)
2. **Layer Separation**: Maintain clean boundaries between Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and Presentation layers
3. **Modular Components**: Small, focused files with single responsibilities
4. **Improved Testability**: Isolated components easier to test
5. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Clear organization and reduced complexity

#### Migration Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Create new folder structure ✅ COMPLETED
- **Phase 2**: Split Security analysis components ⏳ PENDING
- **Phase 3**: Split Performance analysis components ⏳ PENDING
- **Phase 4**: Split Architecture analysis components ⏳ PENDING
