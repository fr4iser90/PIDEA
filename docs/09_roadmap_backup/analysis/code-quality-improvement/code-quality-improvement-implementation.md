## 4. Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Complexity Reduction (8 hours)
- [ ] Analyze high complexity functions in Application.js
- [ ] Break down complex functions into smaller units
- [ ] Extract utility functions for common operations
- [ ] Refactor command classes to reduce complexity
- [ ] Implement helper classes for complex logic
- [ ] Create unit tests for refactored components

#### Phase 2: Code Style Standardization (10 hours)
- [ ] Configure ESLint with strict rules
- [ ] Set up Prettier for consistent formatting
- [ ] Fix all long lines (>120 characters)
- [ ] Standardize naming conventions
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to all public methods
- [ ] Implement consistent error handling patterns
- [ ] Add logging to complex operations

#### Phase 3: Test Coverage Improvement (6 hours)
- [ ] Increase test coverage to 80% minimum
- [ ] Add unit tests for all command classes
- [ ] Create integration tests for complex workflows
- [ ] Implement test utilities and fixtures
- [ ] Add performance tests for critical paths
- [ ] Set up automated test reporting

## 5. Code Standards & Patterns
- **Coding Style**: ESLint with strict rules, Prettier formatting
- **Naming Conventions**: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch with specific error types, proper error logging
- **Logging**: Winston logger with structured logging
- **Testing**: Jest framework, 80% coverage requirement
- **Documentation**: JSDoc for all public methods

## 6. Security Considerations
- [ ] Input validation for all command parameters
- [ ] Sanitize file paths and user inputs
- [ ] Implement proper error handling without information leakage
- [ ] Add audit logging for all operations
- [ ] Validate configuration files

## 7. Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: < 100ms for command execution
- **Memory Usage**: < 50MB for analysis operations
- **Database Queries**: Optimize any database operations
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache analysis results for 5 minutes

## 8. Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests:
- [ ] Test file: `backend/tests/unit/Application.test.js`
- [ ] Test cases: All public methods, error scenarios, edge cases
- [ ] Mock requirements: File system, external APIs

#### Integration Tests:
- [ ] Test file: `backend/tests/integration/CommandExecution.test.js`
- [ ] Test scenarios: Command execution, workflow integration
- [ ] Test data: Sample projects, configuration files

#### E2E Tests:
- [ ] Test file: `backend/tests/e2e/CodeQualityWorkflow.test.js`
- [ ] User flows: Complete analysis workflow
- [ ] Browser compatibility: N/A (backend only)

## 9. Documentation Requirements
