## 📋 Phase Overview
- **Phase**: 2 of 3
- **Focus**: AnalysisIssues & AnalysisRecommendations Components Enhancement
- **Estimated Time**: 2 hours
- **Status**: Planning

## 🎯 Objectives
Extend AnalysisIssues and AnalysisRecommendations components to handle security vulnerabilities from 6 security scanners and code quality analysis results with tabbed interfaces.

## 📊 Current State
- AnalysisIssues handles basic layer validation and logic validation
- AnalysisRecommendations shows general recommendations
- Missing security vulnerability support from 6 scanners
- No integration with SecurityAnalysisOrchestrator data

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Files to Modify:
- `frontend/src/presentation/components/analysis/AnalysisIssues.jsx`
- `frontend/src/presentation/components/analysis/AnalysisRecommendations.jsx`

### Security Data Structure (Actual):
```javascript
// SecurityAnalysisOrchestrator data
const securityData = {
  summary: {
    totalSteps: 6,
    completedSteps: 6,
    failedSteps: 0,
    vulnerabilities: [],
    bestPractices: [],
    securityScore: 100
  },
  details: {
    TrivySecurityStep: {
      success: true,
      result: {
        vulnerabilities: [
          {
            type: "code",
            severity: "medium",
            file: "Application.js",
            message: "Environment variable access detected",
            cve: "CWE-200",
            suggestion: "Review and secure this code pattern",
            scanner: "TrivySecurityStep"
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    SnykSecurityStep: { /* similar structure */ },
    SemgrepSecurityStep: { /* similar structure */ },
    SecretScanningStep: { /* similar structure */ },
    ZapSecurityStep: { /* similar structure */ },
    ComplianceSecurityStep: { /* similar structure */ }
  }
};
```

### Code Quality Data Structure (Actual):
```javascript
// CodeQualityAnalysisStep data
const codeQualityData = {
  complexity: {
    averageComplexity: 0.89,
    totalComplexity: 1022,
    highComplexityFiles: 30,
    totalFiles: 1148
  },
  issues: [
    {
      type: "complexity",
      severity: "medium",
      message: "High complexity detected in backend/Application.js",
      suggestion: "Consider breaking down complex functions"
    }
  ]
};
```

### Enhanced Processing Logic:
```javascript
// AnalysisIssues processing
const processedIssues = useMemo(() => {
  const allIssues = [];
  
  // Process security vulnerabilities from 6 scanners
  if (issues.securityAnalysis?.details) {
    Object.entries(issues.securityAnalysis.details).forEach(([scanner, data]) => {
      if (data.success && data.result?.vulnerabilities) {
        allIssues.push(...data.result.vulnerabilities.map(v => ({
          ...v,
          source: scanner,
          category: 'security',
          type: 'security-vulnerability',
          scanner: scanner
        })));
      }
    });
  }
  
  // Process code quality issues
  if (issues.codeQuality?.issues) {
    allIssues.push(...issues.codeQuality.issues.map(i => ({
      ...i,
      source: 'code-quality',
      category: 'quality',
      type: 'code-quality'
    })));
  }
  
  // Process existing layer and logic validation
  if (issues.layerValidation?.violations) {
    allIssues.push(...issues.layerValidation.violations.map(v => ({
      ...v,
      source: 'layer-validation',
      category: 'architecture',
      type: 'layer-violation'
    })));
  }
  
  return allIssues;
}, [issues]);
```

### Tabbed Interface Structure:
```javascript
// AnalysisIssues tabs
const issueTabs = [
  { id: 'security', label: '🚨 Security', icon: '🔒' },
  { id: 'code-quality', label: '📝 Code Quality', icon: '📊' },
  { id: 'architecture', label: '🏗️ Architecture', icon: '🏛️' },
  { id: 'summary', label: '📊 Summary', icon: '📈' }
];

// AnalysisRecommendations tabs
const recommendationTabs = [
  { id: 'security', label: '🔒 Security', icon: '🛡️' },
  { id: 'performance', label: '📈 Performance', icon: '⚡' },
  { id: 'architecture', label: '🏗️ Architecture', icon: '🏛️' },
