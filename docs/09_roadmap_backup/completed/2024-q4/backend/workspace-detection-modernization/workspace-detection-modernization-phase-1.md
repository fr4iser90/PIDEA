# Workspace Detection Modernization â€“ Phase 1: CDP Infrastructure Setup

## Overview
Establish the foundational CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol) infrastructure for workspace detection. This phase creates the connection management system and base classes needed for CDP-based workspace detection, replacing the complex terminal-based approach.

## Objectives
- [ ] Create CDPConnectionManager for managing CDP connections specifically for workspace detection
- [ ] Implement connection pooling and error handling for CDP connections
- [ ] Add CDP connection health monitoring and cleanup
- [ ] Create base CDP service class with common functionality
- [ ] Set up proper logging and error handling for CDP operations

## Deliverables
- File: `backend/infrastructure/external/cdp/CDPConnectionManager.js` - CDP connection management for workspace detection
- File: `backend/domain/services/workspace/CDPWorkspaceDetector.js` - Base CDP workspace detector class
- File: `backend/tests/unit/CDPConnectionManager.test.js` - Unit tests for connection manager
- Documentation: CDP connection management patterns and best practices

## Dependencies
- Requires: Existing ConnectionPool and BrowserManager infrastructure
- Blocks: Phase 2 (Core CDP Detection Services) start

## Estimated Time
4 hours

## Success Criteria
- [ ] CDPConnectionManager successfully manages CDP connections
- [ ] Connection pooling works with existing infrastructure
- [ ] Health monitoring detects and handles connection failures
- [ ] Error handling provides graceful fallbacks
- [ ] Unit tests achieve 90% coverage
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate

## Technical Implementation Details

### CDPConnectionManager Architecture
```javascript
class CDPConnectionManager {
  constructor(connectionPool) {
    this.connectionPool = connectionPool;
    this.workspaceConnections = new Map(); // port -> connection info
    this.healthMonitor = new CDPHealthMonitor();
  }
  
  async getWorkspaceConnection(port) {
    // Reuse existing connection if healthy
    // Create new connection if needed
    // Monitor connection health
  }
  
  async cleanupConnection(port) {
    // Properly close CDP connection
    // Clean up resources
  }
}
```

### Integration Points
- Leverages existing `ConnectionPool` from `backend/infrastructure/external/ConnectionPool.js`
- Uses `BrowserManager` from `backend/infrastructure/external/BrowserManager.js`
- Follows established logging patterns with `@logging/Logger`

### Error Handling Strategy
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Graceful fallback to legacy system during transition
- Comprehensive error logging and monitoring
- Connection health checks every 60 seconds

### Testing Strategy
- Mock CDP connections for unit tests
- Test connection pooling and reuse
- Test error scenarios and fallback mechanisms
- Test health monitoring and cleanup

## Risk Mitigation
- **CDP Connection Failures**: Implement robust retry logic and fallback to legacy system
- **Memory Leaks**: Proper connection cleanup and monitoring
- **Performance Issues**: Connection pooling and reuse strategies
