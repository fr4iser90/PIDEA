## Root Cause Analysis

### **Current Problem:**
The StepRegistry executes ALL steps sequentially, including:
- `GetChatHistoryStep` (117ms)
- `GitGetStatusStep` (19ms)
- `GitGetCurrentBranchStep` (9ms)

**Total: 145ms instead of ~20ms (parallel)**

### **Why This Happens:**
1. **All API calls go through StepRegistry**
2. **StepRegistry.executeStep() runs sequentially**
3. **No distinction between critical (workflow) and non-critical (API) steps**
4. **No parallel execution support**

### **Solution Architecture:**
```javascript
// Step Classification
const criticalSteps = [
  'IDESendMessageStep',
  'CreateChatStep', 
  'TaskExecutionStep',
  'WorkflowExecutionStep'
];

// Parallel Execution for Non-Critical Steps
if (isCriticalStep(stepName)) {
  // Sequential execution (workflows)
  await executeSequentially(step);
} else {
  // Parallel execution (API calls)
  await executeInParallel(step);
}
```

### **Expected Performance Improvement:**
- **Before**: 753ms (sequential)
- **After**: <200ms (parallel)
- **Improvement**: 73% faster view switching
