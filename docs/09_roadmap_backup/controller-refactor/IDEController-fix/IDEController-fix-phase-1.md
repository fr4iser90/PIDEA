# Phase 1: Analysis & Planning - IDEController Fix

**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Date:** Current

## Phase Overview
Analysis and planning phase for fixing IDEController boundary violations by moving business logic to Application Service layer.

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ Analyze Current Codebase Structure
- **File:** `backend/presentation/api/IDEController.js`
- **Analysis:** Identified 1090 lines of code with mixed responsibilities
- **Findings:** Controller directly accesses domain services and infrastructure components
- **Violations:** Multiple boundary violations detected

### ✅ Identify All Impacted Files and Dependencies
**Core Files:**
- `backend/presentation/api/IDEController.js` - Main controller (1090 lines)
- `backend/application/services/IDEApplicationService.js` - Application service (exists, needs extension)
- `backend/Application.js` - Controller initialization
- `backend/infrastructure/dependency-injection/ServiceRegistry.js` - Service registration

**Supporting Files:**
- `backend/presentation/api/ide/IDEFeatureController.js` - Related IDE controller
- `backend/presentation/api/ide/IDESelectionController.js` - Related IDE controller
- `backend/presentation/api/ide/IDEMirrorController.js` - Related IDE controller

**Test Files:**
- `backend/tests/unit/presentation/api/IDEController.test.js` - Unit tests
- `backend/tests/integration/IDEController.integration.test.js` - Integration tests

### ✅ Create Implementation Plan with Exact File Paths
**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Extend IDEApplicationService with missing business logic
2. Refactor IDEController to use only Application Service
3. Remove direct domain/infrastructure dependencies
4. Update constructor and method signatures
5. Ensure proper error handling and validation

**File Modifications Required:**
- `backend/application/services/IDEApplicationService.js` - Add missing methods
- `backend/presentation/api/IDEController.js` - Remove business logic, use Application Service
- `backend/Application.js` - Update controller initialization
- Test files - Update to reflect new structure

### ✅ Validate Technical Requirements and Constraints
**Requirements Validated:**
- ✅ IDEApplicationService exists and is properly registered
- ✅ Service Registry supports dependency injection
- ✅ Application layer architecture is established
- ✅ Layer validation service is available for testing

**Constraints Identified:**
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing API endpoints
- Must preserve existing functionality while improving architecture
- Must handle terminal log operations properly
- Must maintain VSCode-specific functionality

### ✅ Generate Detailed Task Breakdown
**Task Breakdown Created:**
1. **Phase 2:** Foundation Setup - Prepare environment and dependencies
2. **Phase 3:** Core Implementation - Move business logic to Application Service
3. **Phase 4:** Integration & Connectivity - Update controller and connections
4. **Phase 5:** Testing Implementation - Update and create tests
5. **Phase 6:** Documentation & Validation - Update docs and validate
6. **Phase 7:** Deployment Preparation - Prepare for deployment

## Key Findings

### Current Violations Identified
1. **Direct Domain Service Access:**
   - `this.ideManager` - Used in multiple methods
   - `this.cursorIDEService` - Used for IDE-specific operations
   - `this.eventBus` - Used for event publishing
   - `this.browserManager` - Used for browser automation

2. **Direct Infrastructure Access:**
   - `this.taskRepository` - Used for task operations
   - `this.terminalLogCaptureService` - Used for terminal operations
   - `this.terminalLogReader` - Used for log reading

3. **Business Logic in Controller:**
   - IDE switching with port validation
   - Workspace detection and management
   - Terminal command execution
   - VSCode-specific operations
   - DOM debugging operations

### Architecture Improvements Needed
1. **Layer Separation:** Move all business logic to Application Service
2. **Dependency Injection:** Use only Application Service in controller
3. **Error Handling:** Centralize error handling in Application Service
4. **Event Publishing:** Handle events through Application Service
5. **Validation:** Move validation logic to Application Service

## Next Phase Preparation
- ✅ Implementation plan created
- ✅ File structure identified
- ✅ Dependencies mapped
- ✅ Technical requirements validated
- ✅ Task breakdown completed

**Ready to proceed to Phase 2: Foundation Setup**
