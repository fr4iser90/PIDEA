## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### CDP Connection Management
```javascript
// Modern CDP-based connection with pooling
const cdpManager = new CDPConnectionManager({
  maxConnections: 5,
  connectionTimeout: 15000,
  healthCheckInterval: 30000,
  cleanupInterval: 60000
});
```

### Workspace Detection
```javascript
// Direct IDE integration without terminal dependencies
const workspaceInfo = await cdpWorkspaceDetector.detectWorkspace(port);
// Returns: { workspacePath, workspaceName, ideType, extractionMethod }
```

### Git Information Extraction
```javascript
// Combined CDP and local extraction for maximum reliability
const gitInfo = await cdpGitDetector.getGitInformation(workspacePath, port);
// Returns: { isGitRepo, currentBranch, remotes, status, lastCommit }
```

## üöÄ Migration Path

### Safe Migration Process
1. **Backup Legacy Files** - `--backup` flag creates safety copies
2. **Validate New System** - Comprehensive testing before cleanup
3. **Gradual Rollout** - CDP-first with legacy fallback
4. **Performance Monitoring** - Continuous monitoring during transition
5. **Clean Removal** - `--cleanup` flag removes legacy code

### Migration Commands
```bash
# Dry run to see what would be migrated
node scripts/migrate-to-cdp-workspace-detection.js --dry-run

# Full migration with backup
node scripts/migrate-to-cdp-workspace-detection.js --backup --cleanup

# Performance comparison
node scripts/compare-workspace-detection-performance.js --iterations 50
```
