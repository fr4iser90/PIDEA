# Terminal Logging Modernization - Phase 3: Testing & Migration

## 📋 Phase Overview
- **Phase**: 3 of 3
- **Name**: Testing & Migration
- **Estimated Time**: 2 hours
- **Status**: Planning
- **Progress**: 0%

## 🎯 Objectives
- Update all test files for project-based system
- Run migration script to convert existing logs
- Validate new system functionality
- Update documentation and user guides

## 📝 Tasks

### 3.1 Update Test Suite (45 minutes)
- [ ] Update `backend/tests/unit/domain/services/TerminalLogCaptureService.test.js`
- [ ] Update `backend/tests/integration/TerminalLogCapture.test.js`
- [ ] Create `backend/tests/unit/domain/services/ProjectLogManager.test.js`
- [ ] Create `backend/tests/integration/TerminalLogMigration.test.js`
- [ ] Update test data and fixtures for project-based paths

**Test Updates:**
```javascript
// OLD: Port-based test paths
const logDir = '/tmp/IDEWEB/9222/logs';

// NEW: Project-based test paths
const logDir = '/tmp/IDEWEB/projects/test-project/logs';
```

### 3.2 Execute Migration (30 minutes)
- [ ] Run migration script on development environment
- [ ] Verify log file migration success
- [ ] Test log access with new structure
- [ ] Validate permissions and security
- [ ] Create migration report

**Migration Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Backup existing logs
node scripts/backup-terminal-logs.js

# 2. Run migration
node scripts/migrate-terminal-logs-to-project-based.js

# 3. Verify migration
node scripts/verify-terminal-log-migration.js
```

### 3.3 System Validation (30 minutes)
- [ ] Test terminal log capture functionality
- [ ] Verify log file access and permissions
- [ ] Test API endpoints with new structure
- [ ] Validate performance benchmarks
- [ ] Check error handling and edge cases

**Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] Log capture works with project-based paths
- [ ] Log files are accessible and readable
- [ ] API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Performance meets requirements
- [ ] Security permissions are maintained
- [ ] Error handling works properly

### 3.4 Documentation Updates (15 minutes)
- [ ] Update README with new project-based logging
- [ ] Update API documentation for new endpoints
- [ ] Create migration guide for users
- [ ] Update troubleshooting documentation
- [ ] Document new service dependencies

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- [ ] All ProjectLogManager methods tested
- [ ] Updated TerminalLogCaptureService tests
- [ ] Project-to-port mapping tests
- [ ] Security validation tests

### Integration Tests
- [ ] End-to-end log capture with project-based paths
- [ ] API endpoint integration tests
- [ ] Migration script validation tests
- [ ] Backward compatibility tests

### Migration Tests
- [ ] Test migration script with sample data
- [ ] Verify log file integrity after migration
- [ ] Test rollback functionality
- [ ] Validate permission preservation

## 📊 Success Criteria
- [ ] All tests passing (unit, integration, migration)
- [ ] Migration completed successfully without data loss
- [ ] New system validated and working correctly
- [ ] Documentation updated and complete
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] Security requirements satisfied
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained

## 🔄 Dependencies
- **Input**: Integrated services from Phase 2
- **Output**: Fully migrated and tested system
- **Blockers**: Phase 2 completion

## 📝 Notes
- Ensure zero data loss during migration
- Test rollback procedures thoroughly
- Document all changes for future maintenance
- Monitor system performance after migration

## 🚀 Completion
After completing Phase 3, the Terminal Logging Modernization task will be complete. The system will have successfully transitioned from port-based to project-based log organization.

## 📈 Final Validation
- [ ] All phases completed successfully
- [ ] System fully functional with project-based logging
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Migration successful
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Security requirements satisfied
