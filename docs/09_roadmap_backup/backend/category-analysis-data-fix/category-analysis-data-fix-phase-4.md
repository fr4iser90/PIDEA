# Category Analysis Data Fix â€“ Phase 4: Testing & Validation

## Overview
Write comprehensive tests for the category analysis data fix implementation. Test data mapping, WebSocket streaming, and validate the complete solution works correctly.

## Objectives
- [ ] Write unit tests for CategoryDataMapper
- [ ] Write integration tests for category endpoints
- [ ] Test WebSocket streaming with large datasets
- [ ] Validate data mapping works correctly
- [ ] Test error handling and fallback strategies

## Deliverables
- File: `backend/tests/unit/CategoryDataMapper.test.js` - Unit tests for data mapping
- File: `backend/tests/integration/CategoryAnalysisController.test.js` - Integration tests
- File: `frontend/tests/unit/CategoryWebSocketService.test.jsx` - Frontend WebSocket tests
- Test Data: Mock analysis data with various structures
- Validation Report: Complete testing results

## Dependencies
- Requires: Phase 3 completion (Frontend WebSocket Integration)
- Blocks: Task completion

## Estimated Time
0.5 hours

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All unit tests passing
- [ ] All integration tests passing
- [ ] WebSocket streaming tested with large data
- [ ] Data mapping validated with real data
- [ ] Error handling tested and working
- [ ] Performance requirements met

## Technical Details

### Unit Tests
- Test CategoryDataMapper with various analysis types
- Test data transformation logic
- Test error handling for invalid data
- Test mapping between old and new categories

### Integration Tests
- Test category endpoints with real database data
- Test WebSocket streaming functionality
- Test fallback mechanisms
- Test error scenarios and recovery

### WebSocket Testing
- Test large data streaming (> 1MB)
- Test progress indicators
- Test connection handling and reconnection
- Test error handling and fallback

### Data Validation
- Verify data mapping works for all analysis types
- Test with various data structures
- Validate performance with large datasets
- Ensure no data loss during transformation

### Performance Testing
- Test response times for category endpoints
- Test WebSocket streaming performance
- Validate memory usage with large data
- Ensure caching works correctly
