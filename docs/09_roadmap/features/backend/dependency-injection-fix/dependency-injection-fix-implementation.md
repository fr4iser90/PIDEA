## Root Cause Analysis

### Current Problem:
1. **Manual Ordering**: Services registered in specific order manually - **MUST BE REMOVED**
2. **Dependency Conflicts**: Services in later categories need services from earlier categories
3. **No Dependency Graph**: No automatic detection of dependencies
4. **Circular Dependencies**: No detection of circular dependencies
5. **Hard to Maintain**: Adding new services requires manual ordering knowledge
6. **Legacy Code**: Hardcoded service registration order - **MUST BE ELIMINATED**

### Professional Solution:
1. **Dependency Graph**: Build graph of all service dependencies
2. **Topological Sort**: Automatically order services based on dependencies
3. **Lazy Loading**: Load services only when needed
4. **Circular Detection**: Detect and prevent circular dependencies
5. **Validation**: Validate all dependencies before registration
6. **Clean Architecture**: **NO LEGACY CODE** - Complete removal of manual ordering

### Implementation Strategy:
1. **Phase 1**: Build dependency tracking system
2. **Phase 2**: Implement automatic ordering
3. **Phase 3**: **REMOVE** all manual ordering completely
4. **Phase 4**: Add validation and error handling
5. **Phase 5**: **ELIMINATE** all legacy code and hardcoded ordering

This will create a **professional, maintainable dependency injection system** that automatically handles all ordering issues with **ZERO LEGACY CODE**!

### 📋 Task Splitting Recommendations
- **Main Task**: Dependency Injection Ordering Fix (4 hours) → **NO SPLITTING REQUIRED**
- **Reason**: Task is within 8-hour limit and has manageable complexity
- **File Count**: 5 files to modify/create (within 10-file limit)
- **Phase Count**: 4 phases (within 5-phase limit)
- **Dependencies**: Linear execution order, no parallel subtasks needed

## Gap Analysis - Dependency Injection Ordering Fix

### Missing Components
1. **Backend Services**
   - DependencyGraph class (planned but not implemented)
   - ServiceOrderResolver class (planned but not implemented)

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Automatic dependency ordering (manual ordering currently used)
   - Circular dependency detection for services (only exists for tasks)
   - Topological sorting for service registration

3. **Validation**
   - Service dependency validation before registration
   - Circular dependency detection in DI container
   - Dependency resolution error handling

### Incomplete Implementations
1. **ServiceRegistry**
   - Manual category ordering in registerAllServices()
   - No automatic dependency resolution
   - WorkflowOrchestrationService cursorIDEService null injection

2. **ServiceContainer**
   - Basic dependency resolution working
   - No circular dependency detection
   - No topological sorting

3. **Application Integration**
   - Manual service initialization order
   - No validation of service dependencies
   - Hardcoded service resolution order

### Broken Dependencies
1. **WorkflowOrchestrationService**
   - cursorIDEService injected as null (line 349 in ServiceRegistry.js)
   - Manual workaround in Application.js (line 315-320)

2. **Service Registration Order**
   - Infrastructure → Repository → External → Strategy → Domain → Handlers
   - Hardcoded order that may not work for all dependency scenarios

### Task Splitting Analysis
1. **Current Task Size**: 4 hours (within 8-hour limit) ✅
2. **File Count**: 5 files to modify/create (within 10-file limit) ✅
3. **Phase Count**: 4 phases (within 5-phase limit) ✅
4. **Recommended Split**: **NO SPLITTING REQUIRED** - Task is appropriately sized
5. **Dependencies**: Linear execution order, no parallel development needed

### Existing Infrastructure
1. **TaskSequencer** - Has circular dependency detection and topological sorting
2. **StepBuilder** - Has dependency resolution for steps
3. **TaskValidationService** - Has circular dependency validation
4. **FrameworkValidator** - Has basic dependency validation

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Leverage Existing Code**: Reuse patterns from TaskSequencer and StepBuilder
2. **Clean Modern Approach**: Replace manual ordering completely with automatic dependency resolution
3. **No Legacy Code**: Remove all manual ordering and hardcoded service registration order
4. **Validation First**: Add comprehensive validation before automatic ordering

### Risk Assessment
1. **Low Risk**: Task is well-scoped and leverages existing patterns
2. **Medium Risk**: Service resolution changes could affect startup
3. **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing and gradual migration approach
