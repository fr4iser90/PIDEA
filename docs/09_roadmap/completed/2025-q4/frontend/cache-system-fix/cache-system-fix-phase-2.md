# Cache System Fix â€“ Phase 2: Cache Service Enhancement

## Overview
Implement bundle caching methods in CacheService to handle related IDE data together and add cache warming capabilities. Currently CacheService exists but has no bundle methods.

## Objectives
- [ ] Implement bundle caching methods in CacheService (createBundle, getBundle, invalidateBundle)
- [ ] Add cache warming capabilities (warmCache, preloadData)
- [ ] Implement related data invalidation (invalidateRelatedData)
- [ ] Add cache statistics for bundles (getBundleStats)
- [ ] Create hierarchical cache key structure (`tasks:${port}:${projectId}`)

## Deliverables
- File: `frontend/src/infrastructure/services/CacheService.js` - Bundle caching methods
- Feature: Cache warming service integration
- Feature: Related data invalidation system
- Feature: Hierarchical cache key structure
- Monitoring: Bundle-specific cache statistics

## Dependencies
- Requires: Phase 1 completion (cache configuration)
- Blocks: Phase 3 (IDEStore Cache Integration)

## Estimated Time
2 hours

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Bundle caching methods implemented
- [ ] Cache warming service integrated
- [ ] Related data invalidation working
- [ ] Bundle statistics available
- [ ] Hierarchical cache key structure implemented
- [ ] All tests passing
