# Cache System Fix â€“ Phase 4: Cache Warming Service

## Overview
Create CacheWarmingService for proactive loading of IDE data and implement predictive caching based on user behavior. Currently no CacheWarmingService exists.

## Objectives
- [ ] Create CacheWarmingService.js for proactive loading
- [ ] Implement predictive caching based on user behavior (track IDE switching patterns)
- [ ] Add background cache warming for active IDE (preload next likely IDE)
- [ ] Integrate with IDE switching events (warm cache on switch)
- [ ] Add cache warming statistics and monitoring

## Deliverables
- File: `frontend/src/infrastructure/services/CacheWarmingService.js` - New service
- Feature: Predictive caching based on user behavior
- Feature: Background cache warming for active IDE
- Integration: IDE switching event integration
- Monitoring: Cache warming statistics and monitoring

## Dependencies
- Requires: Phase 3 completion (IDEStore cache integration)
- Blocks: Phase 5 (Testing & Documentation)

## Estimated Time
1 hour

## Success Criteria
- [ ] CacheWarmingService created and functional
- [ ] Predictive caching implemented
- [ ] Background warming for active IDE working
- [ ] IDE switching events integrated
- [ ] Cache warming statistics available
- [ ] Performance improvements measurable
