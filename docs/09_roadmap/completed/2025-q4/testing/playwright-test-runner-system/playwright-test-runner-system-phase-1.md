# Phase 1: Foundation Setup

## üìã Phase Overview
- **Phase**: 1
- **Name**: Foundation Setup
- **Estimated Time**: 5 hours
- **Status**: completed
- **Progress**: 100%
- **Completed**: 2025-10-05T12:57:05.000Z

## üéØ Objectives
Set up the basic Playwright test runner infrastructure with core dependencies and configuration.

## üìù Tasks

### 1.1 Install Playwright Dependencies (1 hour)
- [ ] Add @playwright/test to backend package.json (currently only has playwright core v1.44.0)
- [ ] Add Playwright dependencies to frontend package.json (currently missing)
- [ ] Install Playwright browsers
- [ ] Update package-lock.json

### 1.2 Create Basic Playwright Configuration (1.5 hours)
- [ ] Create `tests/playwright/playwright.config.js`
- [ ] Configure browser settings (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [ ] Set up test timeout and retry settings
- [ ] Configure screenshot and video recording

### 1.3 Set Up Test Directory Structure (1 hour)
- [ ] Verify `tests/playwright/tests/` directory exists (already exists)
- [ ] Verify `tests/playwright/utils/` directory exists (already exists)
- [ ] Verify `tests/playwright/fixtures/` directory exists (already exists)
- [ ] Verify `tests/playwright/screenshots/` directory exists (already exists)
- [ ] Verify `tests/playwright/reports/` directory exists (already exists)

### 1.4 Create Initial Test Runner Utility (1.5 hours)
- [ ] Create `tests/playwright/utils/test-runner.js`
- [ ] Implement basic test execution function
- [ ] Add error handling and logging
- [ ] Create test result collection

### 1.5 Configure Environment Variables (1 hour)
- [ ] Add Playwright configuration to .env
- [ ] Set up test data paths
- [ ] Configure browser settings
- [ ] Add logging configuration

## üîß Technical Details

### Files to Create:
- `tests/playwright/playwright.config.js` - Main configuration
- `tests/playwright/utils/test-runner.js` - Core test runner
- `tests/playwright/fixtures/test-data.json` - Sample test data
- `.env` updates - Environment configuration

### Configuration Example:
```javascript
// playwright.config.js
module.exports = {
  testDir: './tests/playwright/tests',
  timeout: 30000,
  retries: 2,
  use: {
    baseURL: process.env.TEST_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:3000',
    screenshot: 'only-on-failure',
    video: 'retain-on-failure',
    trace: 'retain-on-failure'
  },
  projects: [
    { name: 'chromium', use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] } },
    { name: 'firefox', use: { ...devices['Desktop Firefox'] } },
    { name: 'webkit', use: { ...devices['Desktop Safari'] } }
  ]
};
```

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria
- [ ] Playwright dependencies installed
- [ ] Basic configuration working
- [ ] Directory structure created
- [ ] Test runner utility functional
- [ ] Environment variables configured

## üöÄ Next Phase
Phase 2: Core Implementation - Test management and project-specific configuration
