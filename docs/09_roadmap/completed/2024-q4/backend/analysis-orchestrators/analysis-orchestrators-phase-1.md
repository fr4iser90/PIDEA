# Analysis Orchestrators Implementation â€“ Phase 1: Foundation Setup

## Overview
Set up the foundational structure for the 4 new analysis orchestrators following the exact SecurityAnalysisOrchestrator pattern. Create directory structure, base classes, and initial test framework.

## Objectives
- [ ] Create directory structure for new orchestrators
- [ ] Set up base StepBuilder inheritance for all orchestrators
- [ ] Configure logging and error handling patterns
- [ ] Create initial test structure
- [ ] Set up category mapping in routes

## Deliverables
- Directory: `backend/domain/steps/categories/analysis/code-quality/` - Code quality steps
- Directory: `backend/domain/steps/categories/analysis/dependencies/` - Dependency steps
- Directory: `backend/domain/steps/categories/analysis/manifest/` - Manifest steps
- Directory: `backend/domain/steps/categories/analysis/tech-stack/` - Tech stack steps
- File: `backend/domain/steps/categories/analysis/CodeQualityAnalysisOrchestrator.js` - Main orchestrator
- File: `backend/domain/steps/categories/analysis/DependencyAnalysisOrchestrator.js` - Main orchestrator
- File: `backend/domain/steps/categories/analysis/ManifestAnalysisOrchestrator.js` - Main orchestrator
- File: `backend/domain/steps/categories/analysis/TechStackAnalysisOrchestrator.js` - Main orchestrator
- File: `backend/application/services/categories/analysis/code-quality/CodeQualityAnalysisService.js` - Service layer
- File: `backend/application/services/categories/analysis/dependencies/DependencyAnalysisService.js` - Service layer
- File: `backend/application/services/categories/analysis/manifest/ManifestAnalysisService.js` - Service layer
- File: `backend/application/services/categories/analysis/tech-stack/TechStackAnalysisService.js` - Service layer
- File: `backend/presentation/api/categories/analysis/code-quality/CodeQualityAnalysisController.js` - Controller
- File: `backend/presentation/api/categories/analysis/dependencies/DependencyAnalysisController.js` - Controller
- File: `backend/presentation/api/categories/analysis/manifest/ManifestAnalysisController.js` - Controller
- File: `backend/presentation/api/categories/analysis/tech-stack/TechStackAnalysisController.js` - Controller

## Dependencies
- Requires: Existing StepBuilder framework, SecurityAnalysisOrchestrator pattern
- Blocks: Phase 2 (Core Implementation)

## Estimated Time
4 hours
