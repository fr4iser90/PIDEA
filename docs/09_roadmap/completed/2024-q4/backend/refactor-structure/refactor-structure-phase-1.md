# Refactor Structure Analysis – Phase 1: Create Category Structure

## Overview
**Status:** Pending ⏳  
**Duration:** 4 hours  
**Priority:** High

This phase establishes the foundational directory structure for the categorized analysis system. It creates all necessary category directories across all layers and sets up the basic export structure.

## Objectives
- [ ] Create category directories in Domain layer
- [ ] Create category directories in Application layer
- [ ] Create category directories in Infrastructure layer
- [ ] Create category directories in Presentation layer
- [ ] Set up basic index.js files for exports
- [ ] Validate directory structure integrity

## Deliverables
- Directory: `backend/domain/steps/categories/analysis/security/` - Security analysis steps container
- Directory: `backend/domain/steps/categories/analysis/performance/` - Performance analysis steps container
- Directory: `backend/domain/steps/categories/analysis/architecture/` - Architecture analysis steps container

## Implementation Details

### Directory Structure Template
```bash
# Domain Layer
mkdir -p backend/domain/steps/categories/analysis/{security,performance,architecture}

# Application Layer
mkdir -p backend/application/services/categories/analysis/{security,performance,architecture}

# Infrastructure Layer
mkdir -p backend/infrastructure/external/categories/analysis/{security,performance,architecture}

# Presentation Layer
mkdir -p backend/presentation/api/categories/analysis/{security,performance,architecture}
```

### Index.js Template
```javascript
/**
 * [Category] Analysis - Index Export
 * Exports all [category] analysis components for this layer
 */

// TODO: Import specialized components as they are created
// const TrivySecurityStep = require('./TrivySecurityStep');
// const SnykSecurityStep = require('./SnykSecurityStep');
// const SemgrepSecurityStep = require('./SemgrepSecurityStep');
// const ZapSecurityStep = require('./ZapSecurityStep');
// const SecretScanningStep = require('./SecretScanningStep');
// const ComplianceSecurityStep = require('./ComplianceSecurityStep');

module.exports = {
  // TODO: Export specialized components as they are created
  // TrivySecurityStep,
  // SnykSecurityStep,
  // SemgrepSecurityStep,
  // ZapSecurityStep,
  // SecretScanningStep,
  // ComplianceSecurityStep
};
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All category directories created successfully
- [ ] All index.js files created with proper structure
- [ ] Directory permissions set correctly
- [ ] No conflicts with existing files
- [ ] Git tracking initialized for new directories
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect new structure

## Risk Mitigation
- **Low Risk**: Directory creation is straightforward
- **Mitigation**: Use mkdir -p to avoid conflicts, verify permissions
- **Rollback**: Simple directory removal if issues arise

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] All directories exist and are accessible
- [ ] All index.js files are syntactically correct
- [ ] No existing files were overwritten
- [ ] Git status shows new directories as untracked
- [ ] Directory structure matches planned architecture
- [ ] Placeholder exports are properly formatted

## Next Phase Preparation
- [ ] Document current monolithic file locations
- [ ] Identify all import/export relationships
- [ ] Prepare step extraction strategy for Phase 2
- [ ] Set up testing framework for new structure
