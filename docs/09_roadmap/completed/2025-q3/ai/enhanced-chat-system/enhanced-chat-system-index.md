- **Deliverables**: Enhanced IDETypes.js, ChatMessageHandler.js, ChatMessage.jsx

### Phase 2: Response Quality Engine (8 hours)
- **Focus**: Comprehensive response quality assessment
- **Key Features**: Quality scoring, error detection, suggestion generation
- **Dependencies**: Phase 1 completion
- **Deliverables**: ResponseQualityEngine.js, enhanced AutoFinishSystem.js, ConfirmationSystem.js

### Phase 3: Context-Aware Validation (6 hours)
- **Focus**: Context understanding and intent detection
- **Key Features**: User intent understanding, conversation context tracking
- **Dependencies**: Phase 2 completion
- **Deliverables**: ContextAwareValidator.js, enhanced ChatHistoryExtractor.js

### Phase 4: Smart Completion Detection (4 hours)
- **Focus**: Intelligent completion recognition
- **Key Features**: Semantic completion detection, confidence scoring, fallback mechanisms
- **Dependencies**: Phase 3 completion
- **Deliverables**: SmartCompletionDetector.js, enhanced completion integration

## 🎯 Implementation Strategy

### Phase Execution Order:
1. **Phase 1** → **Phase 2** → **Phase 3** → **Phase 4**
2. Each phase builds upon the previous one
3. All phases integrate with existing services
4. Gradual rollout with feature flags

### Success Metrics:
- Code block detection accuracy > 95%
- Response quality scores correlate with user satisfaction
- Context validation improves conversation flow
- Completion detection reduces manual intervention
- All tests pass (unit, integration, e2e)
- Performance requirements met

### Risk Mitigation:
- **Performance Impact**: Implement caching and async processing
- **False Positives**: Use confidence scoring and multi-layer validation
- **Complexity**: Start with simple patterns, iterate based on feedback
- **Integration**: Gradual rollout with feature flags
