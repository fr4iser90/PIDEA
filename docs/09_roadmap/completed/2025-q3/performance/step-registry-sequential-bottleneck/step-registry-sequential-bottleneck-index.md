## 🎯 Problem Summary

### **Current Issue:**
When switching between views in the frontend, the backend becomes slow and unresponsive due to sequential execution of all API calls through the StepRegistry.

### **Root Cause:**
The StepRegistry executes ALL steps sequentially, including:
- `GetChatHistoryStep` (117ms)
- `GitGetStatusStep` (19ms)  
- `GitGetCurrentBranchStep` (9ms)

**Total: 145ms instead of ~20ms (parallel)**

### **Solution:**
Implement parallel execution for non-critical steps while maintaining sequential execution for workflow steps.

### **Expected Improvement:**
- **Before**: 753ms (sequential)
- **After**: <200ms (parallel)
- **Improvement**: 73% faster view switching
