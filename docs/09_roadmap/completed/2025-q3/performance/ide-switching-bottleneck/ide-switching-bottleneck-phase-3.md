## Implementation Details

### Problem Analysis - RESOLVED ✅
The ConnectionPool was implemented but not fully utilized:
- **Connection establishment**: 3-6 seconds per new connection
- **Pool underutilization**: Connections not being reused effectively
- **No pre-warming**: Frequently used ports not pre-connected
- **Performance tracking**: No monitoring of pool health and performance

This resulted in:
- **Slow switching**: 3-6 seconds per connection establishment
- **Resource waste**: Unused connections in pool
- **Poor scalability**: No optimization for frequent switches

### Solution Architecture - IMPLEMENTED ✅

#### 1. IDESwitchOptimizationService Implementation
```javascript
class IDESwitchOptimizationService {
  constructor(browserManager) {
    this.browserManager = browserManager;
    this.optimizationEnabled = true;
    this.performanceThreshold = 100; // 100ms target
  }

  async getOptimizationStatus() {
    const poolHealth = await this.browserManager.getConnectionPoolHealth();
    const poolStats = await this.browserManager.getConnectionPoolStats();
    const performanceStats = this.browserManager.getPerformanceStats();
    
    return {
      optimizationEnabled: this.optimizationEnabled,
      poolHealth,
      poolStats,
      performanceStats,
      recommendations: this.generateRecommendations(poolHealth, poolStats, performanceStats)
    };
  }

  generateRecommendations(poolHealth, poolStats, performanceStats) {
    const recommendations = [];
    
    // Check connection pool health
    if (poolHealth.healthyConnections < poolStats.totalConnections * 0.8) {
      recommendations.push({
        type: 'warning',
        message: 'Connection pool has unhealthy connections',
        action: 'Consider restarting connection pool',
        priority: 'medium'
      });
    }
    
    // Check performance
    if (performanceStats.averageTime > this.performanceThreshold) {
      recommendations.push({
        type: 'performance',
        message: `Average switch time (${performanceStats.averageTime.toFixed(2)}ms) exceeds target (${this.performanceThreshold}ms)`,
        action: 'Monitor connection pool usage and consider increasing max connections',
        priority: 'high'
      });
    }
    
    return recommendations;
  }
}
```

#### 2. BrowserManager Optimization
```javascript
async switchToPort(port) {
  if (this.currentPort === port) {
    return; // Already connected
  }
  
  // Get connection from pool (instant if cached)
  const connection = await this.connectionPool.getConnection(port);
  
  // Update references
  this.currentPort = port;
  this.browser = connection.browser;
  this.page = connection.page;
  
  return connection;
}

async preWarmConnections(ports) {
  for (const port of ports) {
    try {
      await this.connectionPool.preWarmConnection(port);
    } catch (error) {
      logger.warn(`Failed to pre-warm connection for port ${port}:`, error.message);
    }
  }
}

getConnectionPoolHealth() {
  return this.connectionPool.getHealth();
}

getConnectionPoolStats() {
  return this.connectionPool.getStats();
}

getPerformanceStats() {
  return this.performanceTracker.getStats();
}
```
