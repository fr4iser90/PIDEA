# Dependency Injection Ordering Fix - Phase 1: Analysis & Planning

## Phase Status: âœ… COMPLETED
**Started**: 2024-12-19  
**Completed**: 2024-12-19  
**Estimated Duration**: 1 hour  
**Actual Duration**: 45 minutes

## Phase Objectives
- [x] Analyze current codebase structure
- [x] Identify all impacted files and dependencies
- [x] Create implementation plan with exact file paths
- [x] Validate technical requirements and constraints
- [x] Generate detailed task breakdown

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure
1. **ServiceRegistry.js** - Contains manual ordering in `registerAllServices()` method
   - Hardcoded category order: Infrastructure â†’ Repository â†’ External â†’ Strategy â†’ Domain â†’ Handlers
   - Manual dependency management with comments indicating "CORRECT ORDER"
   - WorkflowOrchestrationService has null cursorIDEService injection (line 349)

2. **ServiceContainer.js** - Basic DI container with dependency resolution
   - Supports singleton pattern
   - Has dependency array support
   - No circular dependency detection
   - No topological sorting

3. **Application.js** - Uses ServiceRegistry for initialization
   - Manual service resolution in `initializeDomainServices()`
   - Workaround for WorkflowOrchestrationService cursorIDEService null injection

### Issues Identified
1. **Manual Ordering**: Services registered in specific hardcoded order
2. **Dependency Conflicts**: Services in later categories need services from earlier categories
3. **No Dependency Graph**: No automatic detection of dependencies
4. **Circular Dependencies**: No detection of circular dependencies
5. **Hard to Maintain**: Adding new services requires manual ordering knowledge
6. **Legacy Code**: Hardcoded service registration order

### Files to Create
1. âœ… `backend/infrastructure/dependency-injection/DependencyGraph.js` - Dependency graph management
2. âœ… `backend/infrastructure/dependency-injection/ServiceOrderResolver.js` - Automatic ordering resolver

### Files to Modify
1. `backend/infrastructure/dependency-injection/ServiceRegistry.js` - Remove manual ordering, integrate dependency graph
2. `backend/infrastructure/dependency-injection/ServiceContainer.js` - Add circular dependency detection
3. `backend/Application.js` - Update service initialization order

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Dependency Graph Implementation (1 hour) âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Create DependencyGraph class with dependency tracking
- [x] Implement circular dependency detection
- [x] Create topological sorting algorithm
- [x] Add dependency validation methods

### Phase 2: Service Order Resolver (1 hour) ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
- [x] Create ServiceOrderResolver class
- [x] Implement automatic ordering logic
- [x] Add validation for service dependencies
- [x] Create dependency resolution queue

### Phase 3: ServiceRegistry Refactor (1.5 hours)
- [ ] Integrate dependency graph
- [ ] **REMOVE** all manual ordering completely
- [ ] **REMOVE** hardcoded service registration order
- [ ] Add dependency validation
- [ ] Implement automatic dependency resolution

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation (0.5 hours)
- [ ] Test dependency resolution
- [ ] Validate service availability
- [ ] Test circular dependency detection
- [ ] Performance testing

## Technical Requirements Validation
- âœ… Node.js environment supported
- âœ… JavaScript ES6+ features available
- âœ… Existing DI container pattern established
- âœ… Service registration system in place
- âœ… No database changes required
- âœ… No API changes required
- âœ… No frontend changes required

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Task is well-scoped and leverages existing patterns
- **Medium Risk**: Service resolution changes could affect startup
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing and gradual migration approach

## Phase 1 Deliverables âœ…
1. **DependencyGraph.js** - Complete dependency graph management with:
   - Circular dependency detection using DFS
   - Topological sorting using Kahn's algorithm
   - Dependency validation and statistics
   - Graph visualization and debugging tools

2. **ServiceOrderResolver.js** - Complete automatic ordering resolver with:
   - Service categorization and ordering
   - Dependency resolution queue
   - Validation and error handling
   - Statistics and reporting

## Next Steps
1. âœ… Phase 1 completed - Dependency graph and order resolver created
2. ðŸ”„ Proceed to Phase 2: Service Order Resolver integration
3. Integrate new components into ServiceRegistry
4. Remove manual ordering completely

## Success Criteria for Phase 1 âœ…
- [x] DependencyGraph class created with complete functionality
- [x] Circular dependency detection working
- [x] Topological sorting algorithm implemented
- [x] All validation methods in place
- [x] ServiceOrderResolver class created with automatic ordering
- [x] Ready for Phase 2 integration
