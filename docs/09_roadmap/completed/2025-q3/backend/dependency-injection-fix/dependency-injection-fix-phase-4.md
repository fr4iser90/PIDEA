## Technical Implementation

### Lifecycle-Hooks Architecture
```javascript
{
  name: 'database',
  deps: [],
  factory: () => new Database(),
  lifecycle: {
    onStart: async (db) => await db.connect(),
    onStop: async (db) => await db.disconnect(),
    onError: async (db, error) => await db.handleError(error)
  }
}
```

### DevTools CLI Structure
```bash
# Dependency validation
node tools/validate-deps.js

# Dependency visualization
node tools/dependency-graph.js --visualize

# Performance analysis
node tools/performance-analyzer.js

# Health check
node tools/health-check.js
```

### Graphviz Integration
```javascript
// Generate DOT format for Graphviz
const dotGraph = dependencyGraph.toDotFormat();
// Generate PNG/SVG visualization
const visualization = await generateGraphvizImage(dotGraph);
```
