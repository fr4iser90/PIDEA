# PIDEA Roadmap - Status-Based Structure

## 📋 Overview

This directory contains the comprehensive roadmap and task management system for PIDEA. All tasks are organized by **status first**, then **priority**, then **category** to provide immediate visibility into what needs to be done, what's currently being worked on, and what has been completed.

## 🗂️ Status-Based Directory Structure

### 🎯 **Status-First Organization**
- **`pending/`** - Tasks waiting to be started (organized by priority)
- **`in-progress/`** - Tasks currently being worked on
- **`completed/`** - Finished tasks (organized by completion quarter)
- **`blocked/`** - Tasks blocked by external dependencies
- **`cancelled/`** - Tasks that were cancelled or deprioritized

### 🚀 **Priority-Based Organization (within pending/)**
- **`high-priority/`** - Critical tasks requiring immediate attention
- **`medium-priority/`** - Important tasks for next development cycle
- **`low-priority/`** - Nice-to-have tasks for future consideration

### 📁 **Category-Based Organization**
- **`backend/`** - Backend development tasks
- **`frontend/`** - Frontend development tasks
- **`performance/`** - Performance optimization tasks
- **`security/`** - Security-related tasks
- **`analysis/`** - Analysis and refactoring tasks
- **`automation/`** - Automation and tooling tasks
- **`ai/`** - AI and chat system tasks
- **`ide/`** - IDE integration tasks
- **`database/`** - Database optimization tasks

## 📊 Current Status Distribution

### 🎯 **Immediate Status Visibility**
- **Pending**: 26 tasks (46%) - organized by priority
- **In Progress**: 5 tasks (9%) - currently being worked on
- **Completed**: 12 tasks (21%) - organized by completion quarter

### 🚀 **Priority-Based Organization**
- **High Priority**: 16 pending tasks - critical work
- **Medium Priority**: 10 pending tasks - important work  
- **Low Priority**: 5 pending tasks - nice-to-have work

## 🔄 **Automatic Status Transitions**
When a task status changes:
1. **pending → in-progress**: Move to `in-progress/`
2. **in-progress → completed**: Move to `completed/2024-q4/`
3. **completed → archive**: Move to `completed/archive/` (after 1 year)

## 🎯 **Navigation Examples**

### Find High Priority Backend Tasks:s```bash
ls docs/09_roadmap/pending/high-priority/backend/
```

### See What's Currently Being Worked On:
```bash
ls docs/09_roadmap/in-progress/
```

### Check Completed Tasks This Quarter:
```bash
ls docs/09_roadmap/completed/2024-q4/
```

### Find All Performance Tasks:
```bash
find docs/09_roadmap -path "*/performance/*" -type d
```

### Find All High Priority Tasks:
```bash
ls docs/09_roadmap/pending/high-priority/
```

### Find All Backend Tasks (any status):
```bash
find docs/09_roadmap -path "*/backend/*" -type d
```

## 📈 **Progress Tracking**

### Current Status Distribution:
- **High Priority Pending**: 16 tasks (29%)
- **Medium Priority Pending**: 6 tasks (11%)
- **Low Priority Pending**: 4 tasks (7%)
- **In Progress**: 5 tasks (9%)
- **Completed**: 12 tasks (21%)

### Category Progress:
- **Backend**: 8/24 completed (33%)
- **Frontend**: 4/8 completed (50%)
- **Performance**: 0/6 completed (0%)
- **Analysis**: 0/8 completed (0%)
- **Security**: 0/1 completed (0%)

## 🔧 **Implementation Notes**

### File Naming Convention:
- **Format**: `[task-name]-[type].md`
- **Examples**: 
  - `analysis-standardization-index.md`
  - `task-queue-management-implementation.md`
  - `ide-switching-bottleneck-phase-1.md`

### Directory Structure:
- **Status First**: `pending/`, `in-progress/`, `completed/`
- **Priority Second**: `high-priority/`, `medium-priority/`, `low-priority/`
- **Category Third**: `backend/`, `frontend/`, `performance/`, etc.

**This structure provides:**
- ✅ **Immediate status visibility**
- ✅ **Priority-based organization**
- ✅ **Category-based filtering**
- ✅ **Automatic status transitions**
- ✅ **Progress tracking**
- ✅ **Easy navigation**

**Total Files**: 377 files organized into clear status-based structure
**Total Tasks**: 43 tasks with clear priority and status visibility

### When to Use Phase-Based Organization:
- **Complex features** requiring research and analysis
- **New domains** where you need to explore before implementing
- **Architecture decisions** that need thorough planning
- **AI-assisted development** where you want to separate ideation from implementation

### Integration with Category System:
- Phase-based tasks can reference category-based tasks
- Use category system for implementation details
- Phase system for high-level project flow

## 📊 Task Management System

### Task Types
1. **Master Tasks** - Large, complex tasks that need splitting
2. **Subtasks** - Manageable pieces of work (≤8 hours)
3. **Implementation Tasks** - Specific implementation steps
4. **Documentation Tasks** - Documentation and guides

### Task Metadata
Each task includes:
- **Priority**: High, Medium, Low
- **Estimated Hours**: Time estimation
- **Dependencies**: Required prerequisites
- **Automation Level**: manual, assisted, semi_auto, full_auto, adaptive
- **Category**: Domain classification
- **Status**: pending, in_progress, completed, blocked

### Task Splitting Rules
- **Maximum Size**: 8 hours per subtask
- **Maximum Files**: 10 files per subtask
- **Dependencies**: Clear dependency chain
- **Parallelization**: Independent subtasks can run in parallel

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Creating a New Task
1. Choose appropriate category in `features/`
2. Create markdown file with task specification
3. Include all required metadata
4. Split into subtasks if >8 hours

### Task Template

## Technical Requirements
- Tech stack
- Architecture patterns
- Dependencies

## Implementation Phases
1. Phase 1 (X hours)
2. Phase 2 (X hours)
3. Phase 3 (X hours)

## Success Criteria
