- [ ] Implement extend session functionality with API integration
- [ ] Add session warning notifications with different severity levels
- [ ] Integrate with existing NotificationSystem for consistent UX
- [ ] Add comprehensive testing for warning system components

## Deliverables
- File: `frontend/src/presentation/components/auth/SessionWarningModal.jsx` - Enhanced warning modal
- File: `frontend/src/infrastructure/hooks/useSessionWarning.js` - Custom hook for session warnings
- File: `frontend/src/infrastructure/utils/SessionTimer.js` - Countdown timer utility
- API: `POST /api/session/extend` - Enhanced session extension with validation
