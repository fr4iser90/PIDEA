# Authentication Session Management Improvements â€“ Phase 3: Activity-Based Session Extension

## Overview
Implement intelligent session management that automatically extends user sessions based on detected activity. This phase creates an activity tracking system that monitors user interactions and extends sessions proactively, reducing unnecessary logouts and improving user productivity.

## Objectives
- [ ] Create ActivityTrackerService for comprehensive user activity detection
- [ ] Implement automatic session refresh based on user activity
- [ ] Add configurable timeout settings for different activity types
- [ ] Create backend logic for activity-based session extension
- [ ] Add comprehensive testing for activity tracking system

## Deliverables
- File: `frontend/src/infrastructure/services/ActivityTrackerService.jsx` - User activity detection service
- File: `frontend/src/infrastructure/hooks/useActivityTracking.js` - React hook for activity tracking
- File: `backend/domain/services/security/SessionExtensionService.js` - Backend session extension logic
- File: `backend/domain/entities/UserActivity.js` - User activity entity
- API: `POST /api/session/extend-activity` - Activity-based session extension
- API: `GET /api/session/activity-status` - Current activity status
- Test: `frontend/tests/unit/ActivityTrackerService.test.jsx` - Unit tests for activity tracking
- Test: `backend/tests/unit/SessionExtensionService.test.js` - Unit tests for session extension

## Dependencies
- Requires: Phase 2 completion (Session Warning System, Session API)
- Blocks: Phase 4 (Multi-Tab Synchronization & Analytics) start

## Estimated Time
5 hours

## Success Criteria
- [ ] ActivityTrackerService detects all relevant user interactions
- [ ] Sessions automatically extend based on user activity
- [ ] Configurable timeout settings work correctly
- [ ] Backend validates activity before extending sessions
- [ ] All activity tracking tests pass
- [ ] No performance impact from activity monitoring
- [ ] Activity tracking respects user privacy settings

## Technical Implementation Details

### ActivityTrackerService Features
- Mouse movement and click detection
- Keyboard input monitoring
- Scroll position tracking
- Focus/blur event handling
- Touch gesture detection for mobile
- Debounced activity reporting
- Configurable activity thresholds

### Activity Types Monitored
- Mouse movements and clicks
- Keyboard input (typing, shortcuts)
- Scroll events
- Window focus/blur
- Touch events (mobile)
- Form interactions
- Navigation events

### Session Extension Logic
- Activity-based extension triggers
- Configurable extension intervals
- Maximum extension limits
- Activity validation on backend
- Extension history tracking
- Abuse prevention mechanisms

### Backend Session Extension Service
- Activity validation and scoring
- Session extension calculation
- Rate limiting for extensions
- Activity pattern analysis
- Security validation for extensions
- Audit logging for all extensions

### Configuration Options
- Activity detection sensitivity
- Extension interval settings
- Maximum session duration
- Activity timeout thresholds
- Privacy settings for tracking
- Performance optimization options

### Integration Points
- SessionMonitorService integration
- AuthStore integration for session updates
- Backend API integration for extensions
