# Authentication Session Management Improvements â€“ Phase 1: Proactive Session Monitoring

## Overview
Implement proactive session monitoring system that automatically validates user sessions and provides early warning before expiry. This phase establishes the foundation for all session management improvements by creating the core monitoring service and integrating it with the existing authentication system.

## Objectives
- [ ] Create SessionMonitorService with timer-based validation
- [ ] Implement session expiry warning system
- [ ] Add session state persistence for graceful handling
- [ ] Create backend session monitoring API endpoints
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests for SessionMonitorService

## Deliverables
- File: `frontend/src/infrastructure/services/SessionMonitorService.jsx` - Core session monitoring service
- File: `frontend/src/presentation/components/auth/SessionWarningModal.jsx` - Session expiry warning UI
- File: `backend/domain/services/security/SessionActivityService.js` - Session activity tracking service
- File: `backend/presentation/api/SessionController.js` - Session management API endpoints
- API: `GET /api/session/status` - Session status endpoint
- API: `POST /api/session/extend` - Session extension endpoint
- Test: `frontend/tests/unit/SessionMonitorService.test.jsx` - Unit tests for monitoring service
- Test: `backend/tests/unit/SessionActivityService.test.js` - Unit tests for activity service

## Dependencies
- Requires: Existing AuthStore, NotificationSystem, AuthService
- Blocks: Phase 2 (Session Warning System) start

## Estimated Time
5 hours

## Success Criteria
- [ ] SessionMonitorService automatically validates sessions every 5 minutes
- [ ] Users receive warnings 2 minutes before session expiry
- [ ] Session state persists across browser refreshes
- [ ] Backend provides session status and extension endpoints
- [ ] All unit tests pass with 90% coverage
- [ ] Integration with existing AuthStore works seamlessly
- [ ] No performance impact on application load time

## Technical Implementation Details

### SessionMonitorService Features
- Timer-based session validation (every 5 minutes)
- Warning system (2 minutes before expiry)
- State persistence using localStorage
- Integration with NotificationSystem
- Automatic cleanup on logout

### SessionWarningModal Features
- Countdown timer display
- Extend session button
- Logout now button
- Auto-dismiss after timeout

### Backend Session API
- Session status endpoint with expiry information
- Session extension endpoint with validation
- Activity logging for analytics
- Rate limiting for extension requests

### Integration Points
- AuthStore integration for session state management
- NotificationSystem integration for user warnings
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates
- localStorage integration for state persistence
