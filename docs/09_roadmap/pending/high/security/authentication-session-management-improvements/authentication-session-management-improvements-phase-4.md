# Authentication Session Management Improvements â€“ Phase 4: Multi-Tab Synchronization & Analytics

## Overview
Implement cross-tab session synchronization and comprehensive session analytics to provide a seamless user experience across multiple browser tabs and gain insights into session usage patterns for optimization.

## Objectives
- [ ] Create CrossTabSyncService using BroadcastChannel API for tab synchronization
- [ ] Implement session state synchronization across browser tabs
- [ ] Add comprehensive session analytics and logging
- [ ] Create session optimization features based on usage patterns
- [ ] Add comprehensive testing for cross-tab functionality

## Deliverables
- File: `frontend/src/infrastructure/services/CrossTabSyncService.jsx` - Multi-tab session synchronization
- File: `frontend/src/infrastructure/hooks/useCrossTabSync.js` - React hook for cross-tab sync
- File: `backend/domain/services/analytics/SessionAnalyticsService.js` - Session analytics service
- File: `backend/domain/entities/SessionAnalytics.js` - Session analytics entity
- API: `GET /api/session/analytics` - Session usage analytics
- API: `POST /api/session/sync` - Cross-tab synchronization endpoint
- Test: `frontend/tests/unit/CrossTabSyncService.test.jsx` - Unit tests for cross-tab sync
- Test: `frontend/tests/integration/MultiTabSession.test.jsx` - Integration tests for multi-tab functionality

## Dependencies
- Requires: Phase 3 completion (Activity-Based Session Extension)
- Blocks: None (Final phase)

## Estimated Time
4 hours

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Session state synchronizes across all browser tabs
- [ ] Logout in one tab immediately affects all other tabs
- [ ] Session analytics provide meaningful insights
- [ ] Optimization features improve session management
- [ ] All cross-tab functionality tests pass
- [ ] Analytics data is accurate and useful
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal
