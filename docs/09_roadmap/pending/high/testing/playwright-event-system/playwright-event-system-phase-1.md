# Playwright Event System – Phase 1: Backend Event Emission

## Overview
Implement event emission in the PlaywrightTestApplicationService to trigger events when configuration is saved or fails.

## Status: ✅ Completed - 2025-10-06T01:50:21.000Z

### Completed Objectives:
- [x] Add event emission to PlaywrightTestApplicationService.saveConfigurationToDatabase()
- [x] Add playwright:config:saved event emission for success
- [x] Add playwright:config:failed event emission for errors
- [x] Add proper logging for event emission
- [x] Test event emission in service

### Implementation Details:
- Added event emission logic in PlaywrightTestApplicationService.js (Lines 541-566)
- Events include projectId, config/error, and timestamp
- Proper error handling and logging implemented
- Fallback handling for missing EventBus

## Deliverables
- File: `backend/application/services/PlaywrightTestApplicationService.js` - Add event emission logic
- Test: `backend/tests/unit/PlaywrightEventSystem.test.js` - Unit tests for event emission
- Log: Event emission logging with structured data

## Dependencies
- Requires: Existing EventBus system
- Blocks: Phase 2 (Application Event Handlers)

## Estimated Time
1 hour

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Configuration save triggers playwright:config:saved event
- [ ] Configuration failure triggers playwright:config:failed event
- [ ] Event data includes projectId, config, and timestamp
- [ ] Proper error handling and logging implemented
- [ ] Unit tests pass for event emission
