# Playwright Event System – Phase 2: Application Event Handlers

## Overview
Add event handlers in Application.js to process playwright events and broadcast them via WebSocket.

## Status: ✅ Completed - 2025-10-06T01:50:21.000Z

### Completed Objectives:
- [x] Add playwright:config:saved event handler in Application.js
- [x] Add playwright:config:failed event handler in Application.js
- [x] Configure WebSocket broadcast for playwright events
- [x] Add event logging in Application.js
- [x] Test event flow from service to WebSocket

### Implementation Details:
- Added event handlers in Application.js setupEventHandlers() method (Lines 1281-1298)
- WebSocket broadcast configured for both success and failure events
- Proper error handling for missing WebSocketManager
- Event data sanitization with REDACTED labels for security

## Deliverables
- File: `backend/Application.js` - Add event handlers and WebSocket broadcast
- Test: `backend/tests/integration/PlaywrightEventFlow.test.js` - Integration tests
- Log: Event handler logging and WebSocket broadcast confirmation

## Dependencies
- Requires: Phase 1 completion (Backend Event Emission)
- Blocks: Phase 3 (Frontend Event Listeners)

## Estimated Time
1 hour

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Event handlers properly registered in Application.js
- [ ] WebSocket broadcast works for playwright events
- [ ] Event data properly formatted for frontend consumption
- [ ] Integration tests pass for complete backend flow
- [ ] Proper error handling for WebSocket failures
