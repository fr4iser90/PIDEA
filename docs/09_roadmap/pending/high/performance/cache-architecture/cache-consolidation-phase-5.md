## File Impact Analysis

### Files to Modify:
- [ ] `config/cache-config.js` - Production configuration
- [ ] `frontend/src/infrastructure/services/CacheService.js` - Production optimizations
- [ ] `backend/infrastructure/cache/BackendCache.js` - Production configuration
- [ ] Environment configuration files - Production settings

### Files to Create:
- [ ] `monitoring/cache-performance-dashboard.js` - Performance monitoring
- [ ] `scripts/cache-health-check.js` - Health check script
- [ ] `docs/production-cache-monitoring.md` - Production monitoring guide

## Testing Requirements

### Production Tests:
- [ ] Production health checks
- [ ] Performance validation tests
- [ ] Cache functionality tests
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Error scenario tests

### Monitoring Tests:
- [ ] Performance monitoring tests
- [ ] Alert system tests
- [ ] Dashboard functionality tests
- [ ] Data collection tests

### Test Coverage:
- **Target**: 100% production functionality coverage
- **Critical Paths**: All production cache operations
- **Edge Cases**: Production error scenarios, performance limits

## Performance Requirements
- **Cache Hit Rate**: 80%+ in production
- **Response Time**: <100ms for cache operations
- **Memory Usage**: <50MB total cache memory
- **Uptime**: 99.9%+ availability
- **Error Rate**: <0.1% error rate

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Staging deployment successful
- [ ] Performance testing completed
- [ ] All issues identified and fixed
- [ ] Production deployment successful
- [ ] Performance monitoring active
- [ ] All performance requirements met
- [ ] Cache consolidation project complete
- [ ] Success metrics validated

## Risk Mitigation
- **Risk**: Production deployment issues - **Mitigation**: Staging validation, rollback procedures
- **Risk**: Performance degradation - **Mitigation**: Performance monitoring, optimization
- **Risk**: Integration failures - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing, fallback mechanisms

## Project Completion Criteria
- [ ] One cache system replaces 7+ fragmented systems
- [ ] 80% cache hit rate achieved (vs previous 100% miss rate)
- [ ] Selective invalidation prevents unnecessary cache clearing
- [ ] Memory usage reduced to <50MB (vs previous multiple instances)
- [ ] All tests passing (unit, integration, e2e)
