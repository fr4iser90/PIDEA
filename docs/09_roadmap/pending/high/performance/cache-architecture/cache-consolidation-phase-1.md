# Cache Architecture Consolidation - Phase 1: Foundation Setup

## Phase Overview
- **Phase Name**: Foundation Setup
- **Phase Number**: 1
- **Estimated Time**: 24 hours
- **Status**: Pending
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Created**: 2025-01-27T12:45:00.000Z

## Phase Goals
Establish the foundation for cache consolidation by creating the main CacheService with centralized configuration, event-driven invalidation system, and cache strategy interface.

## Detailed Tasks

### Task 1.1: Create CacheService with Centralized Configuration (8 hours)
- [ ] Create `frontend/src/infrastructure/services/CacheService.js`
- [ ] Implement centralized TTL configuration system
- [ ] Add memory management with automatic cleanup
- [ ] Create cache key generation with namespacing
- [ ] Add cache statistics and monitoring
- [ ] Implement cache compression for large entries

**Technical Requirements:**
- Support multiple cache layers (memory, IndexedDB, server)
- Configurable TTL per data type
- Memory usage monitoring and limits
- Cache key namespacing to prevent conflicts
- Compression for entries >1MB

**Success Criteria:**
- CacheService created with all core functionality
- Centralized configuration system working
- Memory management implemented
- Cache statistics collection active

### Task 1.2: Set Up Event-Driven Cache Invalidation System (6 hours)
- [ ] Create `frontend/src/infrastructure/services/CacheInvalidationService.js`
- [ ] Implement event-specific cache invalidation
- [ ] Add cache tagging system for selective invalidation
- [ ] Create invalidation event handlers
- [ ] Integrate with existing EventCoordinator

**Technical Requirements:**
- Event-driven invalidation based on component type
- Cache tagging for selective invalidation
- Integration with WebSocket events
- Support for batch invalidation operations

**Success Criteria:**
- Selective invalidation working
- Event-driven system integrated
- Cache tagging system functional
- No more global cache clearing

### Task 1.3: Configure Centralized TTL Management (4 hours)
- [ ] Create `config/cache-config.js` with unified configuration
- [ ] Define data-type specific TTL values
- [ ] Implement TTL validation and enforcement
- [ ] Add TTL override capabilities
- [ ] Create TTL monitoring and alerts

**Technical Requirements:**
- Data-type specific TTL configuration
- TTL validation and enforcement
- Override capabilities for special cases
- Monitoring and alerting for TTL violations

**Success Criteria:**
- One TTL configuration system
- Data-type specific TTLs working
- TTL validation implemented
- Monitoring system active

### Task 1.4: Create Cache Strategy Interface (3 hours)
- [ ] Create `frontend/src/infrastructure/services/CacheStrategy.js`
- [ ] Define cache strategy interface
- [ ] Implement cache-aside pattern
- [ ] Add write-through and write-behind strategies
- [ ] Create strategy factory pattern

**Technical Requirements:**
- Cache strategy interface definition
- Multiple strategy implementations
- Strategy factory for dynamic selection
- Strategy-specific configuration

**Success Criteria:**
- Cache strategy interface created
- Multiple strategies implemented
- Factory pattern working
- Strategy selection functional

### Task 1.5: Set Up Cache Analytics Foundation (3 hours)
- [ ] Create `frontend/src/infrastructure/services/CacheAnalytics.js`
- [ ] Implement cache performance metrics collection
- [ ] Add hit/miss ratio tracking
- [ ] Create performance monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Set up alerting for performance issues

**Technical Requirements:**
- Real-time cache performance metrics
- Hit/miss ratio tracking
- Performance monitoring dashboard
- Alerting for performance degradation

**Success Criteria:**
- Analytics system created
- Performance metrics collection active
- Dashboard functional
- Alerting system working

## File Impact Analysis

### Files to Create:
- [ ] `frontend/src/infrastructure/services/CacheService.js` - Main cache service
- [ ] `frontend/src/infrastructure/services/CacheInvalidationService.js` - Selective invalidation
- [ ] `config/cache-config.js` - Centralized configuration
- [ ] `frontend/src/infrastructure/services/CacheStrategy.js` - Strategy interface
- [ ] `frontend/src/infrastructure/services/CacheAnalytics.js` - Performance monitoring

### Files to Modify:
- [ ] `frontend/src/infrastructure/services/EventCoordinator.js` - Add cache invalidation events
- [ ] `frontend/src/infrastructure/services/RefreshService.js` - Update to use new cache service

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests:
- [ ] `frontend/tests/unit/CacheService.test.jsx` - Core cache functionality
- [ ] `frontend/tests/unit/CacheInvalidationService.test.jsx` - Invalidation logic
- [ ] `frontend/tests/unit/CacheStrategy.test.jsx` - Strategy implementations
- [ ] `frontend/tests/unit/CacheAnalytics.test.jsx` - Analytics functionality

### Test Coverage:
- **Target**: 90% coverage for all new services
- **Critical Paths**: Cache operations, invalidation, TTL management
- **Edge Cases**: Memory limits, TTL expiration, invalidation conflicts

## Success Criteria
- [ ] CacheService created with all core functionality
- [ ] Event-driven invalidation system working
- [ ] Centralized TTL configuration active
- [ ] Cache strategy interface implemented
- [ ] Analytics foundation established
- [ ] All unit tests passing
- [ ] No build errors
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Risk Mitigation
- **Risk**: Complex cache service implementation - **Mitigation**: Incremental development, extensive testing
- **Risk**: Event system integration issues - **Mitigation**: Careful integration testing, fallback mechanisms
- **Risk**: Performance impact during development - **Mitigation**: Performance monitoring, gradual rollout

## Next Phase Dependencies
- CacheService must be fully functional for Phase 2
- Event-driven invalidation system ready for integration
- TTL configuration system ready for data-type specific settings
- Analytics foundation ready for performance monitoring

## Notes
- This phase establishes the foundation for all subsequent phases
- Focus on getting the core architecture right before adding features
- Ensure all services are properly tested and documented
- Monitor performance impact during development
