# Deprecated Execution Classes Cleanup â€“ Phase 2: Test Code Cleanup

## Overview
Remove all test files and test code that reference the deprecated execution classes. This phase ensures that the test suite is clean and doesn't contain references to classes that will be deleted.

## Objectives
- [ ] Delete SequentialExecutionEngine.test.js
- [ ] Delete ExecutionContext.test.js
- [ ] Delete ExecutionResult.test.js
- [ ] Delete ExecutionQueue.test.js
- [ ] Delete BasicSequentialStrategy.test.js
- [ ] Verify no other test files reference deprecated classes

## Deliverables
- Deleted: `backend/tests/unit/workflows/execution/SequentialExecutionEngine.test.js`
- Deleted: `backend/tests/unit/workflows/execution/ExecutionContext.test.js`
- Deleted: `backend/tests/unit/workflows/execution/ExecutionResult.test.js`
- Deleted: `backend/tests/unit/workflows/execution/ExecutionQueue.test.js`
- Deleted: `backend/tests/unit/workflows/execution/strategies/BasicSequentialStrategy.test.js`
- Verification: No remaining test references to deprecated classes

## Dependencies
- Requires: Phase 1 completion
- Blocks: Phase 3 start

## Estimated Time
2 hours

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All test files for deprecated classes removed
- [ ] No test files reference deprecated execution classes
- [ ] Test suite runs without errors
- [ ] No broken test imports
