# Deprecated Execution Classes Cleanup â€“ Phase 1: Production Code Cleanup

## Overview
Remove all references to deprecated execution classes from production code. This phase focuses on cleaning up imports, dependency injection registrations, and service initializations that reference SequentialExecutionEngine, ExecutionContext, ExecutionResult, and ExecutionQueue.

## Objectives
- [ ] Remove ExecutionQueue DI registration from ServiceRegistry.js
- [ ] Remove SequentialExecutionEngine import and initialization from WorkflowOrchestrationService.js
- [ ] Remove ExecutionQueue import and usage from QueueMonitoringService.js
- [ ] Remove ExecutionQueue import and usage from QueueController.js
- [ ] Verify no other production code references exist

## Deliverables
- File: `backend/infrastructure/dependency-injection/ServiceRegistry.js` - Remove ExecutionQueue registrations
- File: `backend/domain/services/workflow/WorkflowOrchestrationService.js` - Remove SequentialExecutionEngine usage
- File: `backend/domain/services/queue/QueueMonitoringService.js` - Remove ExecutionQueue usage
- File: `backend/presentation/api/QueueController.js` - Remove ExecutionQueue usage
- Verification: No remaining production code references to deprecated classes

## Dependencies
- Requires: None
- Blocks: Phase 2 start

## Estimated Time
3 hours

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All production code cleaned of deprecated execution class references
- [ ] ServiceRegistry no longer registers ExecutionQueue
- [ ] WorkflowOrchestrationService no longer uses SequentialExecutionEngine
- [ ] QueueMonitoringService no longer uses ExecutionQueue
- [ ] QueueController no longer uses ExecutionQueue
- [ ] Application starts without errors
- [ ] No broken imports or runtime errors
