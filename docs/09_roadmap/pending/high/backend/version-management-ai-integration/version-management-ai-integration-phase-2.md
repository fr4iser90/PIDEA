- [x] Create `HybridVersionDetector.js` service
- [x] Combine rule-based and AI analysis results
- [x] Implement weighted scoring system
- [x] Add conflict resolution between detection methods
- [x] Create fallback mechanisms for AI failures

### Step 3: External API Integration (1 hour)
- [x] Complete `VersionAIIntegration.js` implementation
- [x] Add OpenAI API integration
- [x] Add Anthropic API integration
- [x] Implement API key management
- [x] Add rate limiting and error handling

### Step 4: Service Integration (1 hour)
- [x] Update `VersionManagementService.js` with AI methods
- [x] Add new API endpoints for AI analysis
- [x] Update handlers and controllers
- [x] Implement caching for AI responses
- [x] Add performance monitoring

## üìÅ Files to Create/Modify

### Files to Create:
- [x] `backend/domain/services/version/HybridVersionDetector.js` - Hybrid detection service
- [x] `backend/tests/unit/services/version/AIVersionAnalysisService.test.js` - Unit tests

### Files to Modify:
- [x] `backend/domain/services/version/AIVersionAnalysisService.js` - Complete implementation
- [x] `backend/infrastructure/external/VersionAIIntegration.js` - Complete implementation
- [x] `backend/domain/services/version/VersionManagementService.js` - Add AI integration methods
- [x] `backend/application/handlers/categories/version/VersionManagementHandler.js` - Add AI command handling
- [x] `backend/presentation/api/controllers/VersionController.js` - Add AI analysis endpoints

## üß™ Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for AI analysis service
- [ ] Unit tests for hybrid detector
- [ ] Integration tests for external API calls
- [ ] Performance tests for AI response times
- [ ] Error handling tests for API failures

## üîí Security Considerations
- [ ] Secure API key storage and retrieval
- [ ] Input sanitization for AI prompts
- [ ] Protection against prompt injection attacks
- [ ] Audit logging for all AI analysis requests
- [ ] Rate limiting to prevent abuse

## üìà Success Criteria
- [x] AI analysis service provides accurate version recommendations
- [x] Hybrid approach improves detection accuracy by 30%
- [x] External API integration works reliably
- [x] Fallback mechanisms handle AI failures gracefully
- [x] All tests passing with 90% coverage
- [x] Performance requirements met (< 5 seconds response time)

## üö® Risk Mitigation
- **Risk**: AI API costs and rate limits
- **Mitigation**: Implement caching and rate limiting
- **Fallback**: Robust fallback to rule-based detection
