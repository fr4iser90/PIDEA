# Framework Missing Steps Completion â€“ Phase 2: Core Refactoring Steps

## Overview
Create the core refactoring management framework steps that handle file splitting, import organization, variable renaming, and method extraction/pushing operations.

## Objectives
- [ ] Create split_large_file.js step
- [ ] Create organize_imports.js step
- [ ] Create rename_variable.js step
- [ ] Create extract_interface.js step
- [ ] Create pull_up_method.js step
- [ ] Create push_down_method.js step

## Deliverables
