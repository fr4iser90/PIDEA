## Root Cause Analysis

### Why State Management Makes API Calls
The state management makes API calls to ensure the backend has the correct state because:

1. **Distributed State**: Frontend and backend maintain separate state
2. **State Synchronization**: Backend needs to know which IDE is active for operations
3. **Browser Connection**: Backend browser manager needs to connect to the correct IDE port
4. **Workspace Context**: Backend needs workspace information for project operations

### Why Performance Degrades with More Switches
1. **Request Stacking**: Multiple rapid switches create queued requests ‚úÖ Resolved with RequestQueuingService
2. **Double Switching**: Each switch triggers browser switching twice ‚úÖ Mostly resolved (sendMessage methods remain)
3. **No Deduplication**: Identical requests are processed multiple times ‚úÖ Resolved with RequestDeduplicationService
4. **Cache Invalidation**: Frequent switches invalidate caches ‚úÖ Resolved with TTL-based caching
5. **Connection Pool Exhaustion**: Browser connections accumulate without cleanup ‚úÖ Resolved with cleanup intervals

### Why the Backend Needs Correct State
1. **Browser Automation**: Playwright needs to connect to the correct IDE port
2. **Project Context**: Backend operations need correct workspace information
3. **Chat Sessions**: Chat messages need to be sent to the correct IDE
4. **Terminal Operations**: Terminal commands need correct IDE context
5. **File Operations**: File operations need correct workspace path

This analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the IDE switching performance issues and shows significant progress in resolution with remaining minor issues to address.
