# Version Management System – Phase 3: Release Automation

## Overview
**Status:** Planning ⏳  
**Duration:** 6 hours  
**Priority:** High

This phase implements automated release management with Git integration, release tagging, and enhanced release branch strategies.

## Objectives
- [ ] Implement release management service
- [ ] Create automated release tagging
- [ ] Add release branch strategy enhancements
- [ ] Integrate with Git workflow manager
- [ ] Create release management API
- [ ] Add release automation tests

## Deliverables
- Service: `backend/domain/services/release/ReleaseManagementService.js` - Release management service
- Handler: `backend/application/handlers/categories/release/ReleaseManagementHandler.js` - Release handler
- Command: `backend/application/commands/categories/release/ReleaseManagementCommand.js` - Release commands
- Step: `backend/domain/steps/categories/version/ReleaseTagStep.js` - Release tagging step
- Framework: `backend/framework/release_management/framework.json` - Release management framework
- Framework: `backend/framework/release_management/steps/` - Release management steps
- Scripts: `scripts/create-release.js` - Release creation script
- Files: `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` - Release notes template
- Integration: Enhanced ReleaseBranchStrategy.js

## Dependencies
- Requires: Phase 1, 2 completion (version management, changelog generation)
- Blocks: Phase 4 start

## Estimated Time
6 hours

- [ ] Create release PR templates
- [ ] Add Git workflow integration

### 3.3 Release Automation (1.5 hours)
- [ ] Create automated release tagging system

- [ ] Add release deployment integration
- [ ] Create release notification system
- [ ] Add release metrics and tracking

### 3.4 API and Framework (0.5 hours)
- [ ] Create release management API endpoints
- [ ] Create release management framework
- [ ] Add release management steps
- [ ] Create release automation scripts

## Implementation Details

### Release Management Service
```javascript
class ReleaseManagementService {
  async createRelease(version, changelog, options) {
    // Create new release
    // Generate release notes
    // Create Git tag
  }
  
  async publishRelease(releaseId) {
    // Publish release
    // Update status
    // Send notifications
  }
  
  async rollbackRelease(releaseId) {
    // Rollback release
    // Revert changes
    // Update status
  }
}
```

### Enhanced Release Branch Strategy
```javascript
class ReleaseBranchStrategy {
  async createReleaseBranch(version, task) {
    // Create release branch
    // Apply protection rules
    // Set up automation
  }
  
  async tagRelease(version, changelog) {
    // Create Git tag
    // Generate release notes
    // Update release status
  }
}
```

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/releases` - Get release history
- `POST /api/releases/create` - Create new release
- `GET /api/releases/:id` - Get specific release
- `PUT /api/releases/:id` - Update release
- `DELETE /api/releases/:id` - Delete release
- `POST /api/releases/:id/publish` - Publish release
- `POST /api/releases/:id/rollback` - Rollback release

### Release Management Framework
```json
{
  "name": "release_management",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Automated release management framework",
  "steps": [
    {
      "name": "version_bump",
      "description": "Bump version automatically",
      "service": "VersionManagementService"
    },
    {
      "name": "changelog_generation",
      "description": "Generate changelog",
      "service": "ChangelogGeneratorService"
    },
    {
      "name": "release_tag",
      "description": "Create release tag",
      "service": "ReleaseManagementService"
    },
    {
      "name": "release_notes",
      "description": "Generate release notes",
      "service": "ReleaseManagementService"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Release management service implemented
- [ ] Automated release tagging working
- [ ] Git integration functional
- [ ] Release branch strategy enhanced
- [ ] API endpoints operational
- [ ] Release automation working
- [ ] Unit tests passing with 85% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests passing

## Risk Mitigation
- **Git Integration Risk**: Comprehensive testing with Git operations
- **Release Automation Risk**: Implement rollback procedures and monitoring
- **Deployment Risk**: Test release automation in staging environment

## Next Phase Dependencies
- Release automation must be complete
- Git integration must be functional
- API endpoints must be operational
- Tests must be passing

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for ReleaseManagementService
- Unit tests for enhanced ReleaseBranchStrategy
- Integration tests for Git operations
- E2E tests for release workflow
- Performance tests for release automation
- Rollback testing
