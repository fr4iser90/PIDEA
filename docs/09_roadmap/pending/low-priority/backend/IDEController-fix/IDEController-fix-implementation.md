# IDEController Fix Implementation

**Task:** Fix IDEController boundary violations by moving business logic to Application Service
**Category:** controller-refactor
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Status:** In Progress

## Task Overview

The IDEController currently has multiple boundary violations where it directly accesses domain services and infrastructure components instead of using the Application Service layer. This fix will:

1. Move all business logic from IDEController to IDEApplicationService
2. Update IDEController to only handle HTTP concerns
3. Remove direct domain/infrastructure imports from IDEController
4. Ensure proper layer separation

## Current Violations Identified

### ❌ Direct Domain Service Access
- `this.ideManager` - Direct domain service access
- `this.cursorIDEService` - Direct domain service access  
- `this.eventBus` - Direct domain service access
- `this.browserManager` - Direct domain service access

### ❌ Direct Infrastructure Access
- `this.taskRepository` - Direct repository access
- `this.terminalLogCaptureService` - Direct service access
- `this.terminalLogReader` - Direct service access

### ❌ Business Logic in Controller
- IDE switching logic with port validation
- Workspace detection and management
- Terminal command execution
- VSCode-specific operations
- DOM debugging operations

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis & Planning ✅
- [x] Analyze current codebase structure
- [x] Identify all impacted files and dependencies
- [x] Create implementation plan with exact file paths
- [x] Validate technical requirements and constraints
- [x] Generate detailed task breakdown

### Phase 2: Foundation Setup ✅
- [x] Create/update implementation documentation file
- [x] Set up required dependencies and configurations
- [x] Create base file structures and directories
- [x] Initialize core components and services
- [x] Configure environment and build settings

### Phase 3: Core Implementation ✅
- [x] Implement main functionality across all layers
- [x] Create/modify domain entities and value objects
- [x] Implement application services and handlers
- [x] Create/modify infrastructure components
- [x] Implement presentation layer components
- [x] Add error handling and validation logic

### Phase 4: Integration & Connectivity ⏳
- [ ] Connect components with existing systems
- [ ] Update API endpoints and controllers
- [ ] Integrate frontend and backend components
- [ ] Implement event handling and messaging
- [ ] Connect database repositories and services
- [ ] Set up WebSocket connections if needed

### Phase 5: Testing Implementation ⏳
- [ ] Create unit tests for all components
- [ ] Implement integration tests
- [ ] Add end-to-end test scenarios
- [ ] Create test data and fixtures
- [ ] Set up test environment configurations

### Phase 6: Documentation & Validation ⏳
- [ ] Update all relevant documentation files
- [ ] Create user guides and API documentation
- [ ] Update README files and architecture docs
- [ ] Validate implementation against requirements
- [ ] Perform code quality checks

### Phase 7: Deployment Preparation ⏳
- [ ] Update deployment configurations
- [ ] Create migration scripts if needed
- [ ] Update environment variables
- [ ] Prepare rollback procedures
- [ ] Validate deployment readiness

## Files to Modify

### Core Files
- `backend/presentation/api/IDEController.js` - Main controller to refactor
- `backend/application/services/IDEApplicationService.js` - Application service to extend

### Supporting Files
- `backend/Application.js` - Update controller initialization
- `backend/infrastructure/dependency-injection/ServiceRegistry.js` - Update service registration

### Test Files
- `backend/tests/unit/presentation/api/IDEController.test.js` - Update tests
- `backend/tests/integration/IDEController.integration.test.js` - Update integration tests

## Success Criteria
- [x] All business logic moved to IDEApplicationService
- [x] IDEController only handles HTTP concerns
- [x] No direct domain/infrastructure imports in controller
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Layer validation passes
- [ ] Zero boundary violations

## Technical Notes
- IDEApplicationService already exists and is properly registered
- Current controller has mixed responsibilities that need separation
- Some methods already use application service, others need migration
- Terminal log operations need special attention for proper abstraction
