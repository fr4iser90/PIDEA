## 5. Code Standards & Patterns
- **Coding Style**: ESLint with existing project rules, Prettier formatting
- **Naming Conventions**: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes, kebab-case for files
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch with specific error types, proper error logging
- **Logging**: Winston logger with structured logging, different levels for operations
- **Testing**: Jest framework, 90% coverage requirement
- **Documentation**: JSDoc for all public methods, README updates

## 6. Security Considerations
- [ ] Input validation for coverage paths
- [ ] File system access controls
- [ ] Protection against path traversal attacks
- [ ] Audit logging for coverage operations
- [ ] Validation of coverage data integrity

## 7. Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: < 100ms for coverage operations
- **Throughput**: Handle 100+ coverage reports simultaneously
- **Memory Usage**: < 50MB for coverage processing
- **Database Queries**: N/A (file-based)
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache coverage configurations, 1 hour TTL

## 8. Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests:
- [ ] Test file: `tests/unit/services/CoverageManagementService.test.js`
- [ ] Test cases: Configuration loading, directory management, cleanup operations
- [ ] Mock requirements: File system operations, Jest configuration

#### Integration Tests:
- [ ] Test file: `tests/integration/services/CoverageManagementService.test.js`
- [ ] Test scenarios: End-to-end coverage management workflow
- [ ] Test data: Mock coverage reports, various project structures

#### E2E Tests:
- [ ] Test file: `tests/e2e/coverage-management.test.js`
- [ ] User flows: Complete coverage management workflow
- [ ] Browser compatibility: N/A (backend service)

## 9. Documentation Requirements

#### Code Documentation:
- [ ] JSDoc comments for all functions and classes
- [ ] README updates with coverage management features
- [ ] API documentation for coverage endpoints
- [ ] Architecture diagrams for coverage management

#### User Documentation:
- [ ] Coverage management user guide
- [ ] Configuration reference documentation
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide for coverage issues
- [ ] Migration guide from current system

    external: {
      baseDir: 'scripts/output/external-coverage',
      projects: {
        cursor: 'cursor-project',
        vscode: 'vscode-project'
      }
    },
    reports: 'scripts/output/reports'
  },
  cleanup: {
    autoCleanup: true,
    maxAge: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 7 days
    preserveLatest: true
  },
  validation: {
    enabled: true,
    maxFileSize: 10 * 1024 * 1024, // 10MB
    allowedExtensions: ['.json', '.html', '.info']
  }
