    "workspacePath": "/path/to/workspace",
    "projectId": "test-project"
  },
  "projectId": "test-project",
  "timestamp": "2024-12-21T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

### Error Response
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Failed to sync docs tasks",
  "message": "DocsImportService not available"
}
```
```

#### cleanDocsTasks Endpoint
```markdown
## POST /api/projects/:projectId/tasks/clean-docs

Removes all documentation tasks from the database for the specified project.

### Parameters

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "deletedCount": 15,
    "projectId": "test-project"
  },
  "projectId": "test-project",
  "timestamp": "2024-12-21T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

### Error Response
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Failed to clean docs tasks",
  "message": "Task repository not available"
}
```
```

### User Guide Updates

#### Documentation Tasks Management
```markdown
## Documentation Tasks Management

The PIDEA system provides comprehensive documentation task management through the Tasks Panel.

### Features
- **Sync Documentation Tasks**: Import tasks from markdown files in your workspace
- **Clean Documentation Tasks**: Remove all imported tasks from the database
- **View Task Details**: Click on any task to see full details and content
- **Execute Tasks**: Send tasks directly to the AI chat for execution

### How to Use

#### Syncing Documentation Tasks
1. Open the Tasks Panel in the right sidebar
2. Click the "üîÑ Sync" button in the Documentation Tasks section
3. Wait for the sync to complete
4. Review the imported tasks in the list

#### Cleaning Documentation Tasks
1. Open the Tasks Panel in the right sidebar
2. Click the "üóëÔ∏è Clean" button in the Documentation Tasks section
3. Confirm the deletion in the dialog
4. All documentation tasks will be removed from the database

#### Viewing Task Details
1. Click on any task in the Documentation Tasks list
2. A modal will open showing the full task content
3. You can copy the content or send it to the AI chat

#### Executing Tasks
1. Open a task detail modal
2. Click "Send to Chat" to send the task to the AI
3. The AI will help you execute the task step by step
```

### Troubleshooting Guide Updates

#### Common Issues and Solutions
```markdown
## Documentation Tasks Troubleshooting

### Sync Issues

#### "Failed to sync documentation tasks"
**Cause**: The workspace path is not accessible or contains no markdown files
**Solution**: 
1. Ensure your workspace contains a `docs/09_roadmap/tasks/` directory
2. Verify markdown files exist in the features directory
3. Check file permissions for the workspace

#### "DocsImportService not available"
**Cause**: The backend service is not properly initialized
**Solution**: 
1. Restart the backend server
2. Check backend logs for initialization errors
3. Verify all dependencies are installed

### Clean Issues

#### "Failed to clean documentation tasks"
**Cause**: Database connection issues or permission problems
**Solution**:
1. Check database connectivity
2. Verify user permissions
3. Restart the backend server

### Performance Issues

#### Sync takes too long
**Cause**: Large number of markdown files or slow file system
**Solution**:
1. Consider organizing documentation into smaller chunks
2. Use SSD storage for better performance
3. Close other applications to free up system resources

#### Memory usage is high
**Cause**: Large markdown files being processed
**Solution**:
1. Break large documentation files into smaller pieces
2. Restart the application if memory usage becomes excessive
3. Monitor system resources during sync operations
```

## Code Cleanup

### Debug Log Cleanup
Review and clean up any debug logs that were added during development:

1. **TaskController.js**
   - Keep essential logging for production
   - Remove any temporary debug statements
   - Ensure log levels are appropriate

2. **TaskApplicationService.js**
   - Verify logging is consistent
   - Remove any development-only logs
   - Ensure error logging is comprehensive

3. **DocsImportService.js**
   - Review import logging
   - Ensure performance logging is appropriate
   - Clean up any temporary debug output

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] All methods have proper JSDoc documentation
- [ ] Error handling is consistent across all methods
- [ ] Logging levels are appropriate for production
- [ ] No hardcoded values or temporary code
- [ ] All imports are properly organized
- [ ] Code follows project conventions

## Final Validation

### Implementation Review
- [ ] All success criteria from Phase 2 are met
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] Code is clean and production-ready
- [ ] No regressions introduced
- [ ] Performance meets requirements

### Security Review
