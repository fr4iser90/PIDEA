# Docs Sync Fix - Implementation Plan

## 1. Project Overview
- **Feature/Component Name**: Documentation Tasks Sync Fix
- **Priority**: High
- **Category**: backend
- **Estimated Time**: 1 hour (reduced from 4 hours - most work already done)
- **Dependencies**: Git frontend fixes (completed), analysis view fixes (planned)
- **Related Issues**: Missing cleanDocsTasks method in TaskController

### 2. Technical Requirements
- **Tech Stack**: Node.js, Express, SQLite, React
- **Architecture Pattern**: MVC with layered architecture (Presentation → Application → Domain → Infrastructure)
- **Database Changes**: None (existing tasks table)
- **API Changes**: Add missing cleanDocsTasks method to TaskController
- **Frontend Changes**: None (already implemented)
- **Backend Changes**: Implement missing cleanDocsTasks method

### 3. File Impact Analysis
#### Files to Modify:
- [x] `backend/presentation/api/TaskController.js` - ✅ syncDocsTasks method EXISTS and working
- [x] `backend/application/services/TaskApplicationService.js` - ✅ syncDocsTasks method EXISTS and working
- [x] `backend/Application.js` - ✅ Route registration EXISTS
- [x] `frontend/src/presentation/components/chat/sidebar-right/TasksPanelComponent.jsx` - ✅ Error handling EXISTS
- [x] `frontend/src/infrastructure/repositories/APIChatRepository.jsx` - ✅ API methods EXISTS
- [ ] `backend/presentation/api/TaskController.js` - Add missing cleanDocsTasks method

#### Files to Create:
- [x] `backend/domain/services/DocsImportService.js` - ✅ EXISTS and working
- [ ] None (all required services already exist)

#### Files to Delete:
- [ ] None

### 4. Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Complete Missing Method (0.5 hours)
- [x] ✅ syncDocsTasks method in TaskApplicationService - ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
- [x] ✅ syncDocsTasks method in TaskController - ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
