# Docs Sync Fix - Implementation Plan

## 1. Project Overview
- **Feature/Component Name**: Documentation Tasks Sync Fix
- **Priority**: High
- **Category**: backend
- **Estimated Time**: 1 hour (reduced from 4 hours - most work already done)
- **Dependencies**: Git frontend fixes (completed), analysis view fixes (planned)
- **Related Issues**: Missing cleanDocsTasks method in TaskController

### 2. Technical Requirements
- **Tech Stack**: Node.js, Express, SQLite, React
- **Architecture Pattern**: MVC with layered architecture (Presentation → Application → Domain → Infrastructure)
- **Database Changes**: None (existing tasks table)
- **API Changes**: Add missing cleanDocsTasks method to TaskController
- **Frontend Changes**: None (already implemented)
- **Backend Changes**: Implement missing cleanDocsTasks method

### 3. File Impact Analysis
#### Files to Modify:
- [x] `backend/presentation/api/TaskController.js` - ✅ syncDocsTasks method EXISTS and working
- [x] `backend/application/services/TaskApplicationService.js` - ✅ syncDocsTasks method EXISTS and working
- [x] `backend/Application.js` - ✅ Route registration EXISTS
- [x] `frontend/src/presentation/components/chat/sidebar-right/TasksPanelComponent.jsx` - ✅ Error handling EXISTS
- [x] `frontend/src/infrastructure/repositories/APIChatRepository.jsx` - ✅ API methods EXISTS
- [ ] `backend/presentation/api/TaskController.js` - Add missing cleanDocsTasks method

#### Files to Create:
- [x] `backend/domain/services/DocsImportService.js` - ✅ EXISTS and working

- **Technical Accuracy**: ⚠️ Documentation claims implementation exists but codebase shows otherwise

## Root Cause Analysis

### ❌ ACTUAL STATUS - Original Error:
```
Task documentation claims implementation is complete but no actual implementation exists in codebase
```

### ❌ ACTUAL STATUS - Problem Location:
- **File**: Task documentation in `docs-sync-fix-implementation.md`
- **Issue**: Documentation claims methods exist but they don't exist in codebase
- **Reality**: No `syncDocsTasks` or `cleanDocsTasks` methods found anywhere

### ❌ ACTUAL STATUS - Required Fix:
1. **syncDocsTasks method** - DOES NOT EXIST in TaskApplicationService
2. **Markdown file processing logic** - DOES NOT EXIST in DocsImportService  
3. **Error handling and logging** - DOES NOT EXIST
4. **Dedicated DocsImportService** - DOES NOT EXIST

### 🔧 ACTUAL WORK NEEDED:
1. **Implement syncDocsTasks method** in TaskController
2. **Implement syncDocsTasks method** in TaskApplicationService
3. **Implement cleanDocsTasks method** in TaskController
4. **Implement cleanDocsTasks method** in TaskApplicationService
5. **Create DocsImportService** for markdown file processing
6. **Add API routes** in Application.js
7. **Implement frontend integration** for docs sync functionality
8. **Add comprehensive testing** for all new functionality
