# Task Directory Structure Standardisierung â€“ Phase 3: Testing & Validation

## Overview
Create comprehensive tests for the new directory structure system and validate that all directory structures are created correctly. Test migration of existing tasks to ensure backward compatibility.

## Objectives
- [ ] Write unit tests for new structure
- [ ] Write integration tests for task workflows
- [ ] Validate all directory structures are correct
- [ ] Test migration of existing tasks

## Deliverables
- File: `backend/tests/unit/TaskDirectoryStructure.test.js` - Unit tests for new structure
- File: `backend/tests/integration/TaskCreationWorkflow.test.js` - Integration tests
- Documentation: Test coverage report
- Validation: Directory structure validation results

## Dependencies
- Requires: Phase 2 completion
- Blocks: Task completion

## Estimated Time
2 hours

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests achieve 90%+ coverage
- [ ] Integration tests pass for complete workflows
- [ ] All directory structures validated as correct
- [ ] Existing task migration works without data loss
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements (< 100ms for directory creation)
- [ ] All tests pass in CI/CD pipeline
