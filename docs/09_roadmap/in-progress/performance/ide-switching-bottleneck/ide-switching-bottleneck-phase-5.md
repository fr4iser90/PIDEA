## Implementation Details

### Problem Analysis - RESOLVED ✅
Before optimization, IDE switching had severe performance issues:
- **Switching Time**: 4-6 seconds per switch
- **Double Switching**: 6-12 seconds total
- **No Caching**: Redundant operations
- **Poor UX**: UI freezing, no feedback

### Solution Validation - COMPLETED ✅
